Camels Enjoying the Snow in Saudi Arabia &middot; Global Voices 
Saudi camels enjoying the snow in Tabouk, Saudi Arabia, tweets Aysha bint Abdulaziz (@ayosh70) Parts of the desert kingdom of Saudi Arabia are experiencing snowfall &#8212; and netizens are rushing online to document it. 
From photographs to videos, from Twitter to Facebook, and from Instagram to Snapchat, we have a minute by minute feed of what it is like for Saudis to experience snow. 
The snow, although rare in Saudi Arabia, is more common in Tabuk, in northwestern Saudi Arabia and close to the Jordanian border, where snowfall is recorded once every three to four years. 
The Storm Centre shares this snippet of information:

Check out the footage on my account on Snapchat. 
Aysha bint Abdulaziz shares photographs which may have been taken earlier in the day of sheep and camels in the snow: 
Camels in the desert in the snow and what's more beautiful is this flock of sheep 
And Fahad Aldhorfari shares a video of snow falling on a car windshield (not a joke), which has been retweeted almost 70 times at the time of writing this post:

Looking at old pictures takes us back to the days when life seemed simpler. In those faded facades and strange clothes, from one photo to the next, we remember how people once lived. 
Earlier this month, the New York Public Library released more than 180,000 digitized items in the public domain. Readers can now access and download these archived materials from the library for free and also remix the materials to develop and share new content. 
Among the digital archive are old photographs and sketches from Asia and the South Pacific regions showing how people lived in the then-colonized countries. The images provide a rare glimpse of architectures and clothes of the undivided Indian Sub-Continent. 
Throughout India, you will find a number of beautiful grand palaces, which were built by emperors who ruled the region in different periods. Perhaps you've seen photos, but have you ever wondered how they appeared before photography was available everywhere? Take a look.

Located at the centre of Delhi, the Red Fort (Palace of Delhi) was the residence of the Mughal emperor of India for two centuries, until 1857. It evolved over the years. 
How were the lives of people then? Here are some sketches and paintings of the royals and people around them:

Wall of Kindness in Peshawar.

Throughout history, walls have been a symbol of separation, segregation, and division. However, a new phenomenon called “walls of kindness” (Deewar-e-Meherbani) is doing just the opposite. 
Faced by cold weather, Iranians began outdoor charity drives for the homeless and needy by building "walls of kindness." The walls feature clothing hooks beside the phrase, “Take one if you need it. 
Give one if you don't.” 
Iran: Where it all began 
It all started with a bit of snow in Mashhad:

Slowly, the hashtag دیوارمهربانی# (wall of kindness) started filling up with photos, as citizens took up helping the needy: Wall of Kindness #Kerman located on Khajoo street, before the intersection on Khajoo, on the left #yalda in #Kerman 
Wall of kindness in Shahsavar, next to the mosque neighborhood of Shahsavar 
Next up: China 
It didn't take long before pictures of "walls of kindness" in China started popping up on social media. 
The Chinese reports suggest the clothes are for “people in need”:

Photos of a Misty Morning Sun Rising Over Myanmar's Last Royal Capital &middot; Global Voices 
Photo by Zaw Zaw / The Irrawaddy 
This article by Zaw Zaw is from The Irrawaddy, an independent news website in Myanmar, and is republished on Global Voices as part of a content-sharing agreement. 
Located to the northeast of the moat that surrounds the Mandalay Palace, this eponymous hill is a famous viewpoint for tourists and photographers hoping to capture daybreak over Myanmar’s last royal capital. 
The Irrawaddy’s photographer Zaw Zaw got to the top of Mandalay Hill early on January 12, 2016, to await the rising sun. At a cool 12° Celsius, weather and location were perfect to capture the moment as the sun’s rays broke through Mandalay’s morning mist. 
But sightseers be warned: You’ll have to get to the top before 6 am if you want to take in the full breadth of these misty memories.

Girls in developing countries miss up to one week of school or work every month due to lack of sanitary products, inadequate facilities and shame associated with periods. 
Shortcomings in education and poor hygiene during menstruation can also lead to discomfort, rashes and infections. 
But in Bangladesh, India and Nepal, various efforts are underway to help make sanitary napkins affordable and available to the country's women. The message spreads in Bangladesh 
In Bangladesh, the available sanitary napkins on the market are costly. 
Foreign manufactured ones cost more than 120 Bangladeshi taka (US $1.50) as there is a 60% supplementary tax imposed on the imports. 
Can you believe, in our country there may be 50 million menstruating women. But only two or three female sanitary products are "made in Bangladesh" and their quality is not up to mark! Whose negligence is it? 
But there are people who are doing something about it. Girls in a drop-in-centre (shelter home) in Dhaka, run by an NGO called Oporajeyo Bangladesh, are making their own pads by hand with a cost of only 4.50 taka (US $0.06). The organisation provides shelter for these girls with violent or tragic pasts, trains and rehabilitates them for school or work in different garments factories or beauty parlours. 
When they go to mainstream school, they communicate this knowledge to other children, even the teachers don't teach them this. Our girls are telling their friends in their class, and they are also interested. 
So they come to us saying that their friends want the pads. We got an offer from others, who are eager to help with purchasing the raw materials in lot &#8212; 1 tonne of cotton or 1 tonne of elastic rubbers. When we can buy them in lots, the cost will be lower. 
Students at the Art Center College of Design in California have built one low-cost, easy-to-use tool to wash and dry reusable sanitary cloths. And in India, Arunachalam Muruganantham, a school dropout from a poor family in southern India turned social entrepreneur, has 'revolutionised' menstrual health for rural women by inventing a simple machine to make cheap sanitary pads. 
His machines have been installed in more than 1,300 villages in 23 of the 29 states of India. 
A manual machine costs around 75,000 Indian rupees (US $1100) and can provide employment for 10 people. The machine can produce up to 250 pads a day, which cost about 2.5 rupees (US $0.04) each. 
According to a 2011 survey by AC Nielsen, only 12% of India's 355 million menstruating women &#8212; compared to 88% in Japan, 64% in China and nearly 100% in Singapore and Japan &#8212; use sanitary napkins, with 70% of women saying their family can't afford to buy them. 
The rest resort to unhygienic alternatives like non-sanitised clothes with cotton, sometimes combined with ashes and husk sand. Muruganantham, who was recognised in 2014 among Time Magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in the World, shared in a TED talk how he began his movement for sanitary napkins in India. 
His machine was reportedly replicated in Jordan to help Syrian refugees. 
The impact on the environment 
Sinu Joseph, a menstrual health educator from India, comments: The hypocrisy is such that while foreign organizations are promoting the need to introduce sanitary napkins in India by saying that 88% of Indian women are using cloth, in their own country they are promoting reusable cloth pads and menstrual cups, citing environmental reasons. 
If that is the case, then India is far ahead of the rest of the world in being environment friendly. 
What we do need is a simple solution of providing information in schools and communities on maintaining menstrual hygiene, be it with cloth or pads. And leave it to women to decide what they wish to use. 
Menstrual health and hygiene isn’t merely a women’s issue. If a large number of the population is being held back because of a problem which is often ignored then it affects the whole population. If only the policy makers could recognise and accept this truth.

This educational video by the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains their Mărţişor in more depth: 
Four countries-Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania and Moldova-submitted a multinational application to UNESCO in 2013 to protect the Grandma March Day custom as intangible cultural heritage of the Balkan people. 
In December 2015, UNESCO invited the states to resubmit the application, and the process is ongoing. 
In order to promote this common cultural practice, four organizations and cultural institutions from Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania and Serbia have launched the ‘Happy Grandma March Day 2016’ project. It features a traveling exhibition of original handmade amulets from three of the countries as well as panels, documentaries, creative workshops and a bazaar where attendees can buy their very own amulet.

As part of the institutional cross-border partnership ”National Identities Within the United Europe”, this traveling exhibition with unknown final destination will first visit Skopje (Macedonia), then Vidin (Bulgaria) and Buzău (Romania) during March of 2016. The project is meant to directly support the multinational application to UNESCO to inscribe the amulet tradition in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Vasilka Dimitrovska is the co-founder of HAEMUS – Center for Scientific Research and Promotion of Culture, which is one of the sponsors of the Happy Grandma March Day 2016. 
These Speed Drawing Videos Promote Tolerance and Women Empowerment in Indonesia &middot; Global Voices 
A screenshot of the video promoting tolerance in Indonesian society. 
A non-governmental organization (NGO) has produced several speed drawing videos which advocate conflict resolution through peaceful actions in Indonesia. 
The NGO Search for Common Ground used the videos as part of their education campaign to promote women empowerment, tolerance, and preventing extremism in Indonesian society. 
The two videos tackling women participation in governance aim to “transform the public’s attitudes and perceptions of women’s role in democracy, governance, and leadership." Women comprise less than 20 percent of elected leaders in Indonesia. 
To succeed in electing women candidates, political parties need to prepare and create the conditions to encourage women participation in elections. 
The group also released two videos about tolerance and extremism. 
With the spread of extremist and violent doctrines targeting vulnerable youth, the need for alternative messages to violent intolerance that celebrate Indonesia’s spirit of pluralism and unity in diversity is increasingly urgent. 
A Voice From the Front Lines of El Niño in Kenya &middot; Global Voices 
In the arid and dry region of Isiolo in Kenya, a new irrigation scheme has been set up to help communities to learn and adopt new ways and to find an alternative to livestock keeping in order to diversify sources of income to attain self-reliance and resilience to recurring droughts.EU/ECHO/Martin Karimi.

In this two-part series, young voices from Kenya share their struggle and hopes, as the devastating drought pervading the Horn of Africa was followed by unusually heavy rains, in a world that is warmer now than any time in recorded history. 
The testimonies in this series were collected by the Climate Impacts Program at 350.org, an organisation building a global climate movement, and are published on Global Voices as part of a content-sharing agreement. 
Part one is written by Kay Seven, a performing artist from the Kajiado County, not far from the Tanzanian border. 
Kenya is a drought-prone country, primarily because of its peculiar eco-climatic conditions. Rainfall patterns, especially rain failure or erratic rainfall are frequently the cause of natural disasters, where rural livelihoods continuously struggle to adapt. Though not located in the north-eastern part, usually the most impacted by drought and flooding, Kajiado County has suffered this year above-average rainfall from El Niño phenomenon. After critical dry conditions, we have started experiencing rainfall in our district. 
The heavy rains were detrimental for flood-prone areas and coastal lowlands but in a certain way helpful for parched farmland and pastoral communities west of the country. East Africans and large communities across the Horn of Africa have already suffered this year from torrential rains and droughts, which experts said could be linked to the evolving El Niño. 
Meanwhile, floods in northwestern Tanzania killed dozens and left hundreds homeless. 
The severe weather also killed livestock and destroyed crops of maize and cotton. Some communities in Kenya, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Tanzania and Somalia are still recovering from previous El Niño events; particularly the one of 1997-1998 which left victims estimated at 2,000 people and triggered widespread animal disease outbreaks. 
The Horn of Africa was also hit by a severe drought in 2011-2012 which led to dire food insecurity that threatened the livelihoods of over 10 million people. 
An estimated 260,000 people, half of them children, died from famine in Somalia, which was one of the worst-affected areas. In a region that has been regularly exposed to effects of extreme weather events and is experiencing El Niño in a more frequent way, it is imperative for locals to get adequately prepared in order to increase their resilience capacity. 
It is a matter of survival for about 80% of the populations made of farmers and pastoralists communities whose well-being and income largely depend on the stability or not of the climatic patterns. “We are losing young lives due to pest diseases, malnutrition and famine. 
Worse, the long periods of drought have caused repeated conflicts between farmers and pastoralists fighting for the scarce resources." -Words from a song by Kay Seven In the midst of the crisis, the local government has come up with a series of strategies to curb drought effects and support the most affected communities. 
Those strategies include a food storage programme in counties, the formation of small groups called Sacco (a framework where farmers are exposed to farming education and training), increased modern irrigation and reforestation programmes. 
While these efforts have not yet produced tangible results, communities do not lose hope. They believe in the action and solidarity spirits from bottom up to face such disasters and build stronger and resilient communities that are capable of ensuring food security for all and restoring an ecosystem life free from droughts and famine. Though the challenge is still big, the Kajiado community is determined to embrace renewable energy and resist the development of fossil fuels while strengthening its disaster preparedness. In the words of a song of mine: 
We have a responsibility to ensure whoever gets in the womb next gets a better place to spend the rest of his or her life when they are born. We can ensure decline in mortality rate due to famine, flooding or any climatic deserters by becoming responsible in our communities. 
The Zika Virus Threat Looms Large in the Caribbean &middot; Global Voices

Microcephaly is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which the head circumference of newborn babies is smaller than usual. Brazil has since made a connection between the mosquito-borne Zika virus and the foetal brain-damage outbreak &#8212; and doctors there are suggesting that the virus "could be having a wider range of effects" on foetal development. 
Unsurprisingly, the virus is spreading beyond South America. 
In Trinidad and Tobago, the most southerly islands in the Caribbean archipelago, the virus has been declared a national health emergency. 
#Caribbean #News: Trinidad declares health emergency over Zika virus: The post Trinidad declares health emerge... https://t.co/W7BdOdfTqQ — Le JAKO de l'île! (@TwitJAKO) January 31, 2016 
As in other areas where the virus is a threat, women have been advised not to get pregnant, but this is not always a surefire method of prevention in a region where access to contraception may be limited or a low priority for those in lower income brackets, and where religious beliefs often play a role in decisions over artificial birth control. Trinidad and Tobago appears to be taking a proactive approach to the problem, however. 
Rapid Response Units (RRUs) are being set up throughout the twin island republic to deal with the prevalence of the the Aedes Aegypti mosquito, which spreads the disease. 
Fogging and spraying of residential communities, which has not been as widespread as is needed to keep the mosquito population at bay, will also be on the increase. 
The country's health minister has given instructions that during the country's Carnival season, all the major event venues will be sprayed, though he stopped short at screening visitors for the virus at ports of entry, saying it was not a feasible proposition. 
Instead, he encouraged people to take precautions against getting bitten and to ensure that their homes are not breeding grounds for mosquitos. Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation has announced that the Zika virus constitutes a global health emergency: 
Zika-linked disease is WHO emergency https://t.co/NVSsGyLIcM #Caribbean #LatAm — ISLAND SWAG (@islandswagco) February 1, 2016 
Scientists are currently investigating whether the Zika virus is also linked to the nerve disorder Guillain-Barré, which can cause paralysis. 
I have not been well really since the chikungunya. That must be about two years now the pains in my joints have not really left me, just as some had predicted might happen. Dona Gloria, my neighbor who has 25 years on me, stops in front of the bars on my ground floor apartment on her way to the market and we rub our respective wrists and complain about our ankles. 
Of the Zika threat, she wrote: 
Now there is another virus on the way. One that attacks new bornes . 
The women and girls are being told not to get pregnant. But the Catholic Church, which rules here under the Papal Nuncio, forbids the use of contraceptives (ah yes, you think that they use them? that the machos spend their money on latex? that they take showers with raincoats? think again) and abortion is prohibited 
Fears over the spread of the disease and its threat to children still in utero have resulted in several countries issuing travel advisories, which could in turn have a serious negative effect on Caribbean tourism, the economic mainstay of several regional territories. There is currently no treatment or vaccine available for the virus.

There's a community on the Russian social network Vkontakte that takes photos of rust, peeling paint, and decay, and reimagines them as “abstract stories.” 
The creator and sole editor, a man named Sergei Vyskub, invites anybody to join his group and submit photos with ideas about what stories might be contained therein. “Every masterpiece has its own story. 
Vyskub told the website TJournal.ru that he first got the idea for the project when looking at photographs of peeling plaster that reminded him of a statistical chart. His friends helped him attract his first subscribers, sharing “abstract stories” in their own Vkontakte groups. The idea caught on, and some communities on the site with followers in the millions started sharing his work (not always with accreditation). 
He runs another photo project called “Bus Stops,” where he collects pictures of bus stops throughout Russia. He says he has no plans to try to monetize either community (by selling advertisements, for instance). Both projects are a “labor of love,” he told TJournal. The Dead Sea.

Following a Summit-less 2015, This Year Will See Record Attempts to Reach the Peak of Everest &middot; Global Voices Mount Everest from base camp one.

Mount Everest, the tallest mountain in the world, challenges adventurers and record seekers every year. 
Each year, the determination to trek to the summit of Mt.Everest brings thousands of adventurous travelers to Khumbu pic.twitter.com/u299yDVJGB — AmiPlanet (@AmiPlanet) January 9, 2016 
In 2015, however, Everest remained invincible &#8212; no-one could summit the peak for the first time since 1974. The devastating earthquake that killed around 9,000 in Nepal didn’t even spare the highest mountain in the world and its aspiring summiteers. In its wake, nobody could climb Everest during the seven- to ten-day window of opportunity that presents itself each May, as the quake took down the ladders and pathways that provided safe access. 
Attempting to climb the mountain at any other time is even more dangerous, as conditions at the top are very harsh, with temperatures of between -32 to -41 degrees centigrade and winds of more than 150 miles per hour. For the first time in 41 years, nobody reached the summit of Mount Everest. 
Historically, for every 100 climbers who have made it to the summit of mount everest, 4 have died — bharat (@BeingStupid1) December 30, 2015 
Everest summiteer Alan Arnette, in his blog Summits Don’t Matter, wished, for the good of the country, that it were different: 
Yes hundreds will probably return next spring to attempt Everest. 
Some operators will shift to the north, quietly, or in some case loudly, saying it is safer. 
People with nothing more than a Kilimanjaro summit will claim to have the proper experience – until something goes wrong. 
Guides will continue to save lives, doing what they do; and the Everest machine will continue even though it is clear it is time to let Nepal recover. 
The business of Everest 
Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing become the the first people to reach summit of Mount Everest (May 1953) pic.twitter.com/NqoL3BRqLN — Photos of Change (@photosofchange) December 25, 2015 
Tenzing's son has been critical of "the charade that Everest has become", catering to the heavy traffic of Western climbers at the expense of the upkeep and integrity of the mountain. 
Everest may have become a business, but it is one that is still attracting a lot of customers. 
One of the worst avalanches in the mountain's history, in 2014, nearly resulted in a Sherpa boycott of their guide services at Everest, after the families of some of the Nepalese killed in the disaster were offered paltry compensation for their deaths. 
More died in April 2015 due to the avalanche triggered by the Nepal earthquake. 
Compared with the huge sums of money paid by climbers for the privilege of climbing Everest, Sherpas are paid nominally for their expertise &#8212; the lion's share of the money is divided between the tour companies and the Nepalese government. 
What is it like to climb the world's tallest mountain? 
The journey typically starts with landing at the Lukla airport &#8212; one of the most dangerous airstrips in the world &#8212; then trekking to the village of Namche Bazaar. 
Used with permission. The hike from Namche Bazaar to the Everest Base Camp (EBC) is breathtaking &#8212; and often a once in a lifetime experience. The trek through the Everest region may be harsh, but it is also full of adventure.

P K Sherpa's personal experience has given him a lot of respect for this section of the climb: “When I reached the Camp 4 or the death zone, I saw dead bodies scattered here and there. The tragic scene was heart-wrenching. 
Climbers usually start for the summit around midnight. MountEverest.net shared a bit about the experience: It’s completely silent. 
If you do, you whisper. It is absolutely terrifying and you climb and climb, awaiting first ray of dawn. It’s desperately cold.

Climate Change Is All Too Real in Kenya, Where Drought and Famine Affect Millions &middot; Global Voices 
Photo by Flickr user Trocaire.

In this two-part series, young voices from Kenya share their struggle and hopes, as the devastating drought pervading the Horn of Africa was followed by unusually heavy rains, in a world that is warmer now than any time in recorded history. 
The testimonies in this series were collected by the Climate Impacts Program at 350.org, an organisation building a global climate movement, and are published on Global Voices as part of a content-sharing agreement. 
Part two is written by Unelker Maoga, an environmental conservation student. 
Read part one here. For the past few decades Kenyans have been longing for change, change in government practices, change in development strategies, change in national issues. Now, our country is experiencing a different kind of change in the near horizon. Drastic, unexpected change; change we were not looking for: climate change. 
Today, I and many in Kenya have become familiar with newspaper headlines that read: ‘Starvation Claims 14 Lives’; the Governor of Samburu declared a state of emergency as 60% of the locals face food insecurity. 
His exact words were: ‘We will not survive this drought’. Unelker Maoga shares a personal account of the painful impact of the drought in Kenya. 
In the meantime, farmers are reaping losses while pastoralists watch their cattle die. I grew up in Kisii County, in the western part of Kenya. 
This region contributes largely to Kenya’s fruit basket, but we too have noticed the absence of rainfall. In the 1970s my family built a dam within the land my grandfather owned. The dam has been there since I can remember, but in the last two years weather patterns across the country have taught our family not to take this reservoir for granted. As we experience the second round of drying up, the future remains uncertain. 
That well appears to be the only source of survival. Others prefer to keep away from the well, having been attacked by wild animals when trying to reach it. 
There have also been cases of women having miscarriages because of the long distances they are forced to walk in order to fetch water. Our county governments, especially in Wajir, have heard the cry of pastoralists and funded veterinary offices to help them manage hundreds of thousands of livestock in order to minimise the drought-related deaths. Though helpful, these measures seem to be too little and too late, as the sun continues to scorch a large percent of Kenya. 
The Kenyan economy loses 14 billion Kenyan Shillings to drought every year; the country has lost 3% of its GDP in 2015 alone. More than 10 million people are suffering from the effects of famine and the situation is set to worsen, thousands of lives have been lost and still no solutions have been found. 
Millions from the Horn of Africa have been migrating south, headed to our country in order to flee severe famine, yet we too are experiencing the same conditions they seek to avoid. 
As the reality of climate change dawns on us, we watched the 21st Conference of Parties in Paris hoping that the negotiations would be fruitful. We have heard world leaders commend the collective decision made by 195 countries to reduce global emissions in order to not only avoid the 2 ºC warming but pledging to a 1.5 degrees limit. Even as we begin, we dare to hope that this path will one day lead to the end of the combustion of fossil fuels. 
And while we in the Horn of Africa continue our journey in search of a stream of water and look to the skies for long awaited rains, our plea is that the words of the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-Moon will never be forgotten: 
… the time has come to acknowledge that national interests are best resolved by acting in the global interest and solidarity. Nature is sending urgent signals, peoples and countries are threatened as never before… We need to protect the planet that sustains us, for that we need all our hands on deck. 
How Myanmar Residents Are Coping Up With Rising Temperatures Caused by El Niño &middot; Global Voices

This is an article from The Irrawaddy, an independent news website in Myanmar, and is republished on Global Voices as part of a content-sharing agreement. 
The effects of the weather phenomenon El Niño are already being felt in several countries in the Asia-Pacific. 
As El Niño hits the most extreme of its 12- to 18-month cycle, large swaths of Myanmar have been beleaguered by high temperatures and water shortages. Summer typically does not begin until March, but temperatures are already relatively intense. 
In Dala, a town across the river from Yangon, water scarcity is more palpable. Irrawaddy photographers Hein Htet and Pyay Kyaw recently documented how the residents of Rangoon and Dala have been coping with the country’s intense weather conditions. Water rationing in Yangon.

Swasthani Vrata Katha is a month-long Hindu festival during which women fast and pray to the goddess Swasthani to ask for the care and prosperity of their spouses and family members. 
Younger girls fast and pray to get good husbands. 
The ritual begins on the full-moon day of Poush and ends on the full-moon day of Magh (the tenth month of the Nepali calendar), which was yesterday. During the festival, devotees recite scriptures from the Swasthani Vrata Katha (the story book of goddess Swasthani). 
A different chapter is recited once a day for 31 days. Women wake up early in the morning, take a bath, and worship Mahadev, one of the three major deities of Hinduism, in the afternoon, each day of the month. 
Yesterday was the stuff of legend.

The ritual is said to have started after King Himalaya’s daughter Parvati, the Hindu goddess of love, fertility and devotion, spent a month fasting and praying to the goddess Swasthani, asking to marry Mahadev whom she had longed for since childhood. 
Her love for him was no accident &#8212; Parvati was the reincarnation of Mahadev’s first wife Sati Devi, who after immolating herself was reborn. 
The devotees throng to the places mentioned in the Katha: Guheswari, Gokarna, Sleshmantak forest, Gaurighat, Bagmati River, and Shali Nadi (River). In Sankhu and Bhaktapur, both men and women fast, worshiping goddess Swasthani and god Madhav Narayan. People also take part in ritual bathing while observing the Madhav Narayan festival, which starts and ends on the same days as Swasthani Vrata Katha. 
In an opinion piece, Manju Thapa writes: The story says a husband is master while a wife is a servant who needs to serve her spouse. This is not women-friendly as it shows an unbalanced relationship between a husband and wife. 
The tradition continues despite the few outcries. 
While the debate continues, let’s take a glimpse of the Swasthani Vrata Katha and Madhav Narayan festival through the lenses of photographers Sunil Sharma and Archana Shrestha.

SMS Platform Empowers Small Scale Farmers in Uganda &middot; Global Voices

Despite massive advances in technology, the majority of farmers in Africa do not know how to use a smart phone. 
Few of them go online to research about a new species of crops or how to fight a new crop disease. A new startup, WeFarm, intends to empower farmers with information by using the Short Messaging System (SMS). 
Farmers ask questions which are translated and shared with farmers in the same region and beyond. 
Once feedback is generated, it is then sent back to the person who asked the question. 
Some of the countries already benefiting from the Startup include Uganda, Kenya and Peru with over 43,000 users worldwide in the first nine months of its operations. 
It will be launched in Tanzania, Cote D'Ivoire, India, Colombia, and Brazil in the near future. In a blog post on National Geographic, they shared a story of a farmer in Kenya, and how he benefited from the startup: 
Kepha’s chickens are very important to him. 
Not only do they provide eggs for his family to eat, but they’re also his main source of income. 
Kepha can sell chickens to other farmers or at markets when he has the opportunity to visit one. He also farms vegetables and staples that he and his family can eat, but his chickens allow him to earn a modest living. 
Kepha’s story will resonate with many small-scale farmers across Africa, Latin America and Asia. 
Wikipedia for farmers, or as its founder describes it, “Internet for people without Internet.” Nicki Briggs feels this is an initiative that benefits not just the farmers but also the food industry: 
An initiative that benefits farmers, and the food industry = JACKPOT.

The History of Royal Hunts in Nepal’s Southern Plains Is Simply Barbaric &middot; Global Voices Tethered rhinoceros with caged deer in the background.

Nepal’s southern plains are famous not only for fertile agricultural land but also for the dense forests and a plethora of wild animals. 
Now converted into national parks, the area was once a fertile ground for hunting. The current Chitwan National Park was used as a royal hunting reserve from 1846 to 1951 by the Nepali Rana rulers and their guests. 
A set of historic photographs have become viral online showing shocking images of British and Nepali rulers engaging in a bloody hunt of many animals including tigers, bears and rhinoceroses. 
The British royal hunts began in February 1876 AD and were hosted by then-Nepali Prime Minister Jung Bahadur Rana, writes Subodh Rana in his blog: 
He had presided over the Delhi Durbar in celebration of his mother Queen Victoria having been proclaimed the Empress of India on January 1, 1876 A.D. It is written that he was so bored with the formalities of state that coming to shoot in the Terai was the highlight of his India sojourn. 
Later many British Royals followed the tradition invited by the Rana prime ministers. Even Archduke Franz Ferdinand, whose assassination in 1914 triggered the World War I, came to hunt in Nepal invited by Maharajah Bir Shumsher in March 1893. 
However, the most barbaric and horrific hunting trip was that of King George V who visited Nepal after being crowned Emperor of India in 1911. 
The Royal Hunt of Tiger and Rhinoceroses in the Nepalese Terai in 1911 by Kees Rookmaaker, Barbara Nelson and Darrel Dorrington details the hunting spree.

The royal hunt has been documented in 50 photographs from an album donated to The Australian National University. 
The article His Imperial Majesty’s Shoot in Nepalese Terai, December 1911 describes the hunt as: 
The Maharaja's entourage, who were in a separate camp further along the river, numbered 14,000 including 2000 elephant attendants. 
During the hunting that followed Divine Service on 25 December, nearly 600 elephants formed the "ring". 
The King shot the largest tiger of the expedition on that day. Below are select photos from the royal hunt.

Shankarshan Thakur, Delhi-based editor of The Telegraph tweeted: 
Myanmar Rural Villagers Share Their Development Plans Through Facebook &middot; Global Voices 
Community deliberations during the drafting of the 'Village Book'. 
Photo from ActionAid The Village Facebook project encourages Myanmar’s rural citizens to upload their village reports on Facebook so that these can be accessed by government officials, development partners, and potential donors. 
Spearheaded by ActionAid Myanmar, the project uses participatory tools to empower villagers to draft their own "Village Books" to be used as a basis for recommending development projects to local and national authorities. ActionAid said "it is a valuable method because it identifies what the community truly needs, instead of what we think they might need." 
The "Village Book" is a document that contains information generated through community deliberations. It has a social map, seasonal calendar, and problem tree which explains the current situation of the village from the point of view of the residents. It also has spider maps and Venn diagrams to identify the vulnerable groups and power dynamics in the village. 
Finally, it has a dream map and action plan that feature the programs or projects proposed by the villagers. U Han Soe Win of the Kin Pon Chong village in the Meikhtila Township recognizes the value of the "Village Book": “I wished to have a book clearly presenting our village’s situation. 
ActionAid has facilitated the drafting of more than 500 books across Myanmar, and 129 of these books have matching "Village Facebook" pages. The group says the project is inspiring villagers to articulate better the problems facing their community, while providing an opportunity for remote communities to share their dreams and development needs not only with local officials but also potential partners from other countries. For example, the "Village Facebook" of Kon Dine Gyi succeeded in generating subsidies for an education program. 
The photos below introduce some of the activities involved in constructing the books:

After presenting the "Village Book" to a Member of Parliament, a woman from the village petitioned for the construction of a bridge in their community. 
Photo from ActionAid. ActionAid acknowledged that a big challenge to integrating Facebook pages is limited Internet access in many of Myanmar's rural towns. The cost of smartphones is also quite high. 
But the group is optimistic that the country's Internet connectivity will continue to improve over the next several years. ActionAid also emphasizes that the "Village Book" or "Village Facebook" is not the answer to Myanmar’s socio-economic problems, asserting that “comprehensive development requires policymakers at regional and national levels to bring a macro-level vision for just and equitable progress.” 
While national policymakers discuss the blueprint for progress in the country’s capital, however, grassroots initiatives like the "Village Book" and "Village Facebook" are also useful for promoting citizen participation in the development process. Kyrgyzstan Keeps Half an Eye on Renewables &middot; Global Voices 
A functional model of the wind turbine developed by Emil Tursunov. 
Personal photo archive. Used with permission 
An energy deficit in Kyrgyzstan is stimulating a rise in renewable energy practices and optimized consumption, but the shift cannot come quickly enough. 
Sometimes supported by international organizations, other times self-funded, both local businesses and individuals have started implementing a number of innovative projects tapping the country's wind, solar and hydro potential. 
A one-of-a-kind wind turbine 
Emil Tursunov is the proud designer of the truly innovative wind turbine in the photo at the top of this article. 
Its benefits are clear: ease of manufacturing and installation, mobility, low operating costs and the ability to function in both high and low speed winds. 
The object's adaptability to different weather conditions and the smart integration of solar panels ensure reliable and efficient energy conversion. 
The payback period is around three years &#8212; a relatively short term made possible by the low construction costs ($1,000-2,000 depending on production volumes) &#8212; while the turbine can produce enough energy to power household devices and provide electricity and heating for a small apartment. 
Before an intended switch towards mass production, Tursunov plans to display the model at EXPO-2017, an international exhibition themed on 'energy of the future' in neighbouring Kazakhstan. 
Wind energy remains relatively untapped in Kyrgyzstan, even though it could cover up to 7% of the energy needs of rural communities that make up over half of the country's total population. 
Yet whether generating electricity for household consumption or powering water pumps for farms, wind's popularity is growing, especially in the north. 
Local media outlet Kloop.kg recently covered the story of another rural innovator, Beshenbei Saadabaev, who created a cheaper, simpler contraption following years of power outages in his village. 
Energy-efficient school benefits from better insulation and solar energy

While the government introduces new changes to school schedules, extending the winter break in order to reduce consumption of heating, an experimental school in the south of Kyrgyzstan has taken a different approach to saving energy. 
For the last four years, school No. 52 has been benefiting from energy-efficient infrastructure and solar batteries on its roof. 
The batteries, although expensive, have significantly reduced the school's utility bills. 
Solar energy is used to heat the water for the canteen, bathrooms, and gym showers. 
Elena Rodina, then coordinator of the United Nations Development Program's pilot project Improving Energy Efficiency in Buildings, explained at a meeting with government officials following the school's renovation: 
During the heating season in 2012-2013, the school spent 600,000 soms , whereas similar schools had expended around 2,500,000 soms , and achieved a 53% reduction in energy use. 
The innovations are expected to pay off their initial investment in less than nine years. 
A university's down-through-earth energy system

The American University of Central Asia that opened the doors to its new campus in 2015 was the first private company to introduce geothermal heating in the Central Asian region. 
The practical value of geothermal heating systems, known for years, has been mostly ignored in Kyrgyzstan and Central Asia as a whole. 
US Secretary of State John Kerry said at the opening of the new campus last year: 
This new campus is special because it is the first private construction project in Central Asia that is clean green all the way –- that means geothermal heating and cooling, state-of-the-art sewage, irrigation systems, and the highest standard of energy efficiency in the entire region. In simple terms, a geothermal pump exchanges heat between a building and the ground. 
During the cold months, it uses the heat absorbed from the ground and transfers it into the building. 
For cooling, it goes the other way: extracting heat from the building and taking it down to the ground to cool. 
Geothermal heating's efficiency and low maintenance costs make it attractive from an economic standpoint. The university expects to have reduce energy consumption by 87% over time, justifying an expensive initial investment in the pump. 
Currently, it is the start-up costs of such projects, combined with the Soviet legacy of subsidised electricity, that is discouraging more businesses in the country from taking the same route. 
Nevertheless, with the country's Soviet-era system visibly wilting, Kyrgyzstan's energy future seems destined to be determined by off-grid responses to on-grid failure. 18 Stunning Photographs of the Rana Tharus From the Southern Foothills of Nepal &middot; Global Voices 
Rana Tharus - The silver white looks strikingly beautiful on the bright dress and black shawls. 
Image by Solveig Boergen. Used with permissionOnce rich landlords, Rana Tharus &#8212; the natives of Kailali and Kanchanpur districts in far-western Nepal &#8212; have witnessed loot, encroachment and discrimination. Their isolated villages have been regularly looted by dacoits. 
Earlier, they occupied almost 90 percent of the area. It is hard to find written documents about the Rana Tharus as they have lived in isolation, writes Bikram Rana in his blog: 
In India Rana Tharus of Khiri, and Nainital are under scheduled tribes. 
In case of Nepal in terms of habitats Rana Tharus are the native residents of Kailali and Kanchanpur since 16th century and are the first settlers of the two districts later they were joined by Dangauras of Dang and after the eradication of malaria and resettlement plan of Panchayat regime, Khasiyas joined. 
However, despite of all odds, they have not forgotten their culture and tradition. Their way of life remains distinct and their traditional clothes and ornaments are a delight to every photographer and designer. 
Solveig Boergen, a German photographer who lives and works in Japan, travelled to the Kanchanpur district of western Nepal to capture the daily lives of the Rana Tharus. Here is what she saw: 
As the sun peeks from the window of the mud house, an old Rana lady is busy preparing meal. 
She draws inspiration from the nature, the tattoos on her arms and the bright colours of her blouse. 
Like William Wordsworth's Solitary Reaper, the lady reaps the paddy alone. 
Her bright costume stands out in the sea of yellow. 
When her friend joins her, it seems like a competition between the traditional dress she is wearing and the modern dress her mate is adorning. 
Both the colours burn bright in the yellow field. The coming together of the community for a bountiful catch is a moment to watch. 
The joy of working together and sharing the catch – there’s plenty to learn from them. 
The catch is enough for everyone. 
It's the marriage season and the ladies show off their ornaments. 
Mirror! 
Mirror! 
Who is the fairest of all? 
Tell me if I don't look good. 
And they don’t even leave the legs. 
They are laden with the silver ornaments. Like the beautiful patchwork in their dresses, the colours chosen by Ranas form a melange of vivid colours inspired by nature. 
Their smiles are precious and innocent. Whether the young ones will follow the footsteps of their forefathers and conserve the rich culture – the future will decide.All images used with permission.

Government installed Solar Energy panels gives power to 36 houses in the village of Weepatando in Sumba island.

This post by Alexander Creed and Cleo Warner was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine that highlights international environmental solutions in action, and is republished here as part of a content-sharing agreement. As the sun sets on the small Indonesian island of Sumba, Danga Beru Haba begins weaving under the glow of a single incandescent light bulb — the only one in her home. 
Although she is tired from working dawn to dusk in the fields surrounding her village of Kampung Kalihi, the sarong she is weaving to sell locally will provide extra income for her family. 
Being able to weave at night is still a novelty for Haba. Her village has had electricity for only two years, thanks to a small wind farm on a hill overlooking the village. Access to electricity means women can now weave and children can study long after the sun goes down. “I started weaving after we got electricity. 
“Now I can weave until midnight.” She has saved close to US$200 as a result, which she says she’ll spend on her children’s education. Sumba is a largely rural, sparsely populated island, one of thousands in the archipelagic nation of Indonesia. 
Nevertheless, this island of around 650,000 people, accounting for just 0.2 percent of the country’s population, is aiming to set an energy example for all of Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country and Southeast Asia’s largest economy. Through an initiative known as the Iconic Island Sumba project, international donors working with the local government plan to bring electricity to all of the island’s residents using only renewable sources in the next 10 years. 
It’s an ambitious goal, one that is especially timely in light of the recent climate change talks in Paris, where renewable energy was on display as a potential strategy for combating climate change and as a development tool that may allow poorer nations to leapfrog prior roads to wealth dependent on dirty energy sources. Africa has announced plans to provide universal electricity access across the continent, aiming to produce 300 gigawatts of electricity by 2030 using only renewable sources, and France has pledged US$2 billion to the cause. 
A report published by the International Renewable Energy Agency says that increasing renewable energy’s share of the global energy mix to 36 percent by 2030 — double what it was in 2010 — would boost global GDP by 1.1 percent and global human welfare — defined by such factors as health, education and environmental quality — by 3.7 percent. 
A Blessed Island 
Sumba, like much of Indonesia, is blessed with an abundance of natural wind, solar and flowing water. In 2009 the Dutch non-governmental organization Hivos realized the potential these resources offered and conceived of a plan to fully electrify the island using only renewable sources by 2025. Hivos helped launch the Iconic Island Sumba project to “show that access to renewable energy can alleviate poverty even in remote and isolated areas.” In the years since the project began Sumba has managed to electrify more than half of the island. 
In addition to Hivos, the Indonesian NGO IBEKA, the Asian Development Bank and the Norwegian embassy in Jakarta have all become involved in the project, along with local and national Indonesian governments. 
“Now in East Sumba we have every form of renewable energy. We have solar, wind, water and biogas,” says Daniel Lalupanda, chief of the local governmental Energy and Mining Division in East Sumba, through a translator. Despite being a short two-hour flight from the popular tourist destination Bali, Sumba has remained largely untouched by tourism. 
But “wind, hydro, and biogas resources are found throughout the country,” according to research done in 2010 by Hivos and Winrock International, a nonprofit organization dedicated to developing stable communities worldwide that assessed Sumba. After considering “candidate islands” and performing an in-depth analysis on Sumba and one other island, Hivos and Winrock determined that “Sumba seems to have the upper hand being the island with the best technical and institutional potential for the implementation of the ‘iconic island concept.’” 
It didn’t take long for the international community to get on board with Hivos’ idea. In late 2012, the Asian Development Bank, which works to alleviate poverty and encourage sustainable growth in Asia and the Pacific, pledged US$1 million towards technical assistance aimed at scaling up access to renewable energy, including electricity, on Sumba. 
And the Norwegian Embassy in Jakarta pledged close to US$1 million to increase access to renewable energy in southeastern Indonesia, with Sumba as the primary focus. 
“We have much potential for renewable energy, especially solar,” says Lalupanda, and he says support from such outside agencies is crucial. Local Buy-In 
Much of the demand for the plant’s power comes at night. 
In fact, only the school uses electricity during the day, for things such as computers. But at night, most villagers turn on a light for weaving or for children to study. 
“Now that we have access to sustainable electricity all the time, I can keep my shop open a little bit into the night,” says Umbu Windi Ndapangadung, the elected chief of Kamanggih, through a translator. 
“My wife can use a blender to make cakes and the children can help her.” 
Indonesia’s state-owned power utility buys the electricity generated by Kamanggih’s plant and sells it back to the villagers at a predetermined cost. A local co-op, Corporasi Peduli Kasih, handles the sale of the plant’s electricity, reinvesting the profits from the electricity back into the community. 
This money has funded programs for clean water and for producing organic fertilizer from local livestock manure, which can also be sold. “Before we had electricity, it was difficult to empower the people in this community,” says Ndapangadung. “But now that we have electric power they have become more willing to get involved in community programs.” 
Problems Remain 
All four spin freely in the wind — but power nothing, says Petrus Lamba Awang, a local representative of IBEKA. Some of the system’s components have broken, he says, and the locals don’t know how to fix them — an example of the challenges of maintaining technologies in a place like Sumba, where there are very few direct routes anywhere. Many of the villages are isolated, miles from anything or anyone else, and connected only by steep, uneven and unmaintained roads. 
Michael Kristensen, an energy advisor and project manager on renewable energy at the Energy Academy on the Danish island Samsø — which produces all of its electricity via wind turbines — says that such challenges are to be expected. Kristensen is not involved in the Sumba project, but he helped develop the renewable energy project on Samsø. 
When we make projects we always put money aside for expert counseling.” The Indonesian minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Sudirman Said, has publicly supported the Iconic Island Sumba project, but some Indonesians working on Sumba feel Said, and the national government he represents, are not contributing enough to the initiative. 
The minister has been outspoken, but has not taken enough action, locals claim. They want more money and more trained personnel coming to Sumba to work toward accomplishing the island’s goal. 
But I’m concerned about the government at the top.” Because of the island’s terrain and isolated villages, the Indonesian national power utility estimates the cost of installing power lines to get electricity to all residents is US$22,000 per kilometer (0.6 miles) — too expensive for the agency to have considered installing a central power utility on Sumba. 
However, the decentralized nature of small-scale renewable projects may surmount this problem, with lines only being installed in localized areas. 
“When you don’t have an electrical infrastructure already in place, then there will be difficulties, and it will not go that quickly. The grid will expand at its own pace, but of course it’s expensive and it’s a very difficult process to make it happen,” says Kristensen. 
However, these islands differ from Sumba in important ways, including financial resources from the government and local citizens. The renewable energy push on Samsø was led by a few local citizens, and locals own many of the island’s wind turbines. 
Nothing like the Iconic Island Sumba project has ever been done in Indonesia, so there is no recipe for the government to follow, no budget to consult. No one is sure just how much money or effort it will take to get electricity to everyone on Sumba, especially to those located in the most isolated areas. 
Nevertheless, the project continues on Sumba, and if this remote island can achieve its goal, it could be a model for the rest of the world. This story was produced in association with Round Earth Media, which is reclaiming international news.

A lone male elephant named Morgan has shocked conservationists after walking 220 kilometres (137 miles) from Kenya to Somalia. 
The animals have rarely, if at all, been spotted in Somalia in the last 20 years due to the country's civil war. 
Morgan, who is in his 30s, was wearing a tracking collar, which allowed conservationists to see his three-week-long trek northwards. 
Some reports called it the first confirmed sighting of an elephant in Somalia since war broke out in the 1980s, although Al Jazeera quoted local Somalian authorities in September 2015 saying elephants along with lions, leopards, giraffe, buffalo and ostriches had already crossed the border at that point. 
“Out of all the tracking we’ve done in Africa, these movements –- and these circumstances –- are exceptional,” said Iain Douglas-Hamilton of the Save the Elephants organization. “The wandering of this one bull across the entire expanse of Lamu district, from the Tana river to the Somali border, no-one has seen anything like this before.” 
Morgan left the Tana River Delta in Kenya in mid-February and arrived in Somalia early this month. The elephant only spent less than 24 hours in Somalia before turning back. 
Why did elephants leave Somalia 20 years ago? 
The Somali Civil War, an ongoing civil war that started in the 1980s, has not only displaced thousands of people, but also wildlife in the country. As people were fleeing to refugee camps in Kenya, Ethiopia and elsewhere, many wild animals, especially the Big Five (the African lion, African elephant, Cape buffalo, African leopard, and White/Black rhinoceros), migrated to game reserves in Kenya. 
Apart from conflict, animals in Somalia such as elephants suffered from poaching, which was used by militants as a source of income. 
The southern part of Somalia was a sanctuary for Big Five animals before the collapse of the central government of Somalia in 1991. 
The region is arable, compared to the rest of Somalia which is arid and semi-arid, and two largest rivers in Somalia, Jubba and Shabelle, pass through the area. But that same area was one of the most lawless, under the control of the militant group Al Shabaab before they were removed by Somali government forces backed by Kenya. The brief return of Morgan is probably an indication of stability returning to the region. 
As expected, many people have received the news with joy and excitement. 
On Twitter, the Wildlife Conservation Society noted: 
'the BEST thing you can do for Morgan is to please SHUT UP' 
Reacting to Morgan's story posted on the Save the Elephants Facebook page, some readers wondered why the story was not kept secret for the animal's safety. Poachers could use the publicity to find Morgan, they argued, though the current location of Morgan has not been reported other than the fact that the elephant walked three kilometres inside Somalia before turning back. 
Adrienne Hesford wrote: 
the very best thing for Morgan, would have been to keep silent about his existence and whereabouts. I now fear for the safety of him and any other elephants in his area. 
Julie Goodison advised: 
the BEST thing you can do for Morgan is to please SHUT UP about his whereabouts for heavens sake!!!! and dye his tusks of course 
Christie Haskins questioned the logic of the publicity around Morgan's long walk to Somalia: 
This post and publicity is bad because it places this magnificent elephant at unnecessary risk. I'm very worried about him. 
African elephants are considered a vulnerable species, according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, with poaching and habitat destruction being the two biggest threats. 
'Miracles happen' 
Reflecting on the story, Barbara Thomson remarked: 
Miracles happen, now we must keep an eye on this elephant, and the Somalis should be encouraged toward conservation and not killing. 
Julius Mbuyi suggested that Kenya is the best place for Morgan: 
That elephant need to be returned to Kenya at the earnest time possible! 
Nilmini Lekamge suggested a guard for the elephant 
Can they put a guard for him? He is tagged after all. If there is only one, it shouldn't be hard. I hope!! 
One Somali Facebook user, Young Ak, used the opportunity to ask Kenya to return Somali elephants to the country: 
Sweet home sweet welcome back home civil war is over! Kenya should return the remaining Somali Elephants or share 10% of Tourist revenues for 200 years with Somalia. 
This Russian Website Uses Neural Networks to Combine Images, With Awesome Results &middot; Global Voices 
Why not. Image from ostagram.ru. 
Ever felt like adding some Van Gogh-style swirls to your photos? Now you can. A Russian project called Ostagram allows Internet users to combine photos and works of art to create fantastical images that wouldn't be out of place in the world of Alice in Wonderland or in a sci-fi space opera. 
Image from ostagram.ru. 
The Ostagram project, created by user Sergey Morugin, is a web service that uses a computer algorithm to combine the content of one image with the style of another image using convolutional neural networks. This means you can get a photo of your dog to look like a Monet painting, if you pick the dog pic as the source for content, and the Monet artwork as a source for style. 
Researchers from Google, who have been experimenting with artificial neural networks and image recognition, call this combination technique Inceptionism, inspired by the deep neural net architecture and the "We need to go deeper" meme from the movie Inception, itself a speculation on the relationship between dreams and reality. 
Morugin has made the code for his Ostagram web algorithm available to everyone on GitHub and says his combination of neural network processing and an art styling algorithm is based on work by other coders, including Leon Gatys, Alexander Ecker, and Matthias Bethge. 
Check out some of the awesome Inceptionist images generated by Ostagram users below, or better yet, register on the website and create your own.

"#EgyptAir hijacker has explosives…. 
How did he get them on board? Don’t forget though…" tweets @Andy_Wirral, who shares the photograph above 
A seven-hour stand-off with a hijacker who forced an Egypt Air pilot to divert a flight en route from Alexandria to Cairo to make an emergency landing in Larnaca, Cyprus, after claiming he was wearing an explosive belt, has ended, with all the passengers released. 
According to Egypt Air: 
Official sources at EGYPTAIR declared the release of all the hostages and the arrest of the hijacker. #EgyptAir — EGYPTAIR (@EGYPTAIR) March 29, 2016 
It turns out the lone hijacker, identified as Egyptian Seif Eldin Mustafa, was not even wearing a real explosive belt but may have wanted to contact his former wife, a Cypriot national, or call for the release of Egyptian female prisoners. While the details of his motives remain sketchy, netizens are relieved the incident is not related to terrorism, especially that committed by Muslims. 
In the early hours of the drama, authorities claimed that another man had hijacked the plane, raising speculations about his nationality and motives. 
Syrian blogger S. Rifai tweets about the confusion: 
"Please don't be Syrian" 
"please don't be Lebanese" 
My FB right now #EgyptAir — S. Rifai (@THE_47th) March 29, 2016 
While many may be relieved the hijacker wasn't from their country, more are happy the incident has nothing to do with terrorism or Islam. Officials said that the hijacker appeared to be unstable and ruled out terrorism. Omar Imran describes the announcement as "historic": 
Wow Something Historic just happened. 
The Egyptian Hijacker has been declared as "mentally unstable" rather than a "Muslim terrorist" #First — عُمر (@OmarImranTweets) March 29, 2016 
And photojournalist Patrick Baz jovially tweets: 
We can finally celebrate the first Arab Muslim hijacker who is not declared a terrorist but a psychologically unstable person. :) #EgyptAir — patrickbaz (@Patrick_Baz) March 29, 2016 But Islam got some bashing nevertheless. Mohamed Alaraimi wonders: 
How come every time an ignorant person do something so radical the first thing you blame is islam? #egyptair https://t.co/Avq0BYnAWT — Mohamed (@ALaraimi92) March 29, 2016 
And journalist Mohamed El Dahshan still wants to see justice met. 
He tweets: Now, seriously though: "not terrorism"?? I hope he gets the maximum possible penalty. 
He hijacked a goddamn plane. #Egyptair — Mohamed El Dahshan (@eldahshan) March 29, 2016 
Netizen Report: Facebook VP Arrested in Brazil for Refusing to Give Police WhatsApp Data &middot; Global Voices 
By Flickr user Jan Persiel. Uploaded on September 22, 2013. CC BY-SA 2.0 
Global Voices Advocacy's Netizen Report offers an international snapshot of challenges, victories, and emerging trends in Internet rights around the world. Facebook’s vice president for Latin America, Diego Dzodan, was arrested by Brazilian police for refusing to give WhatsApp data to law enforcement for a criminal investigation into drug trafficking. 
WhatsApp was suspended by a judge in Brazil for48 hours in December over a similar refusal to hand over user data in a criminal case. As of March 2, Dzodan was set to be released following a statement by a higher judge who called the extreme measure of imprisonment “hurried.” 
Meanwhile, Bolivian President Evo Morales proposed regulating social networks, because he believes “misinformation spread on them can topple governments.” Claiming social media debates influenced voters’ decisions on a recent referendum on whether he can seek re-election by amending the constitution, Morales said social networks “are wasting the values of new generations.” 
And the Cyberspace Administration of China ordered Sina and Tencent to shut down the accounts of real estate tycoon Ren Zhiqiang, accusing Ren of “illegal messages with negative impact.” Many believe Ren is being punished for a comment he made questioning Chinese President Xi Jinping’s position that state-affiliated media should serve the Communist Party. Following the move, 580 more social media accountswere shut down by the CAC, including those of several celebrity bloggers, for “misleading the public” or “violating regulations.” 
Facebook: Hate speech against migrants will not be tolerated 
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told a group of students during a town hall in Berlin that the company needs to improve its measures to crack down on hate speech against migrants. The company has come under criticism by the German Ministry of Justice for its failure to police racist and anti-immigration posts as effectively as it does sexual imagery. Zuckerberg said there was “not a place for this kind of content on Facebook” and that German law and culture had led to a change in its approach to hate speech. 
Researchers at the Citizen Lab found that thousands of apps that run code produced by Chinese Internet company Baidu are collecting and transferring users’ personal data to the company, much of it in an insecure way. Citizen Lab director Ron Deibertcalled it “either shoddy design or it’s surveillance by design.” 
Angry emojis flood Hong Kong leader’s Facebook page 
Hong Kongers have quickly adapted to Facebook’s new “reactions” features, using the “angry” emoji to flood the Facebook page of their Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying. Within hours of publishing a post, C.Y. Leung’s page was flooded with more than 54,000 angry emojis. The case reveals the limitations of only having a “like” function on the site. 
Until now, CY Leung’s page only featured likes and positive comments, but with the new emoticons, which can't be moderated by page owners, the negative nature of his fame has been unveiled, according to the Hong Kong Free Press.

Cherry blossom illuminations at Kanegasaki Shrine in Tsuruga, Fukui. Image by Nevin Thompson. Late March and early April is cherry blossom time for much of Japan. 
Groves of cherry trees blossom up and down the hillsides, making for a spectacular site. 
While cherry trees bloom throughout most of Japan in March and April, cherry trees in prefectures and regions in colder northeastern Japan, where the winter lasts longer, won't start blooming until later in April. 
Families and groups of friends spread a blue tarp on the ground and eat, drink, and generally relax under the cherry blossoms. 
Many workplaces will organize a company cherry blossom-viewing excursion. 
If it rains, it means a quick end to the cherry blossom season, as the petals are washed away. But beautiful weather is just around the corner. 
Jamaican “green” entrepreneur Jovan Evans demonstrates his invention on World Water Day. Photo courtesy Mr. Evans, used with permission. 
On World Water Day (March 22) the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), in partnership with the Jamaican Government, launched the Jamaica Green Economy Scoping Study in a garden setting at Kingston's Devon House. 
The study, covering five sectors (Agriculture, Construction, Energy, Tourism, and Water) was funded by the European Commission under its regional program on "Advancing Caribbean States' Sustainable Development Through Green Economy". Jamaica is one of the most heavily indebted countries in the world, with 90 percent of its current energy needs dependent on imported petroleum. 
The country seems ripe for transition to a low carbon economy, but it's yet to be seen if the Jamaican private sector is ready to make that leap. Meanwhile, there is hope: innovators like Jovan Evans are paving the way and turning innovative eco-friendly ideas into products. Global Voices had the opportunity to speak with Evans to discuss his ideas, entrepreneurial spirit, and “going green” transition. 
Global Voices (GV): Tell us a little about your background. How did your upbringing and education prepare you for entrepreneurship? 
I graduated from the University of the West Indies with a B.Sc. in Computer Science and for ten years I worked in the IT sector. This was until January 2015, when I left the “nine-to-five” world to start my company, AquaFlow Products &amp; Services Ltd. As an IT professional you are always solving problems, whether it's infrastructure acquisition and deployment or software implementation and development. 
There are many things that contributed to my development as an entrepreneur, but the most notable to me are the skills I gained throughout the years working for and with others. Academia played a small role in my journey and I found training from entrepreneur-targeted workshops was more impactful. 
Photo courtesy Jovan Evans, used with permission. GV: What gave you the idea &#8212; and why did you see the need &#8212; for your Pump-N-Spray? JE: Pump-N-Spray was born from frustration: the annoyance of bucket bathing every night because of water restrictions, a back-breaking chore I was introduced to on my grandfather’s farm decades prior. One day I forgot to catch my water, and that was the straw that “broke my back”. 
I originally sought to buy a solution but couldn’t find one, so this “camel” decided to build one. 
After six weeks I developed my first prototype. 
At that time, the pump-n-spray was just for myself. When the water situation was regularized I actually shelved it; but months later water restrictions were back and I was forced to use my Pump-N-Spray. It was then it dawned upon me that other persons were having the same challenge and that more than likely they would also be interested in my creation. Climate change indicates that water accessibility is not going to improve, so Pump-N-Spray was set to be a winner. 
GV: Did you simply go it alone or did you have supporters and backers to get you started? 
JE: I was alone in the product development process and financing for most of my journey; but I was fortunate to get into the Branson Centre of Entrepreneurship and that helped a lot with the business development. I recall the last day of my job of nine years was also the day I was accepted as an official Branson Centre Entrepreneur. 
GV: Tell us about your partnership with Flint, Michigan. How did this come about? JE: Essita Duncan, a lawyer from Washington, DC, started this initiative. 
She was part of a small audience with whom I shared my entrepreneurial journey. Weeks later, she made contact with me and introduced me to the water crisis in Flint and a non-profit she was a part of, Servants without Borders. They had heard the stories and visited the communities in Flint and were moved by the state of their water situation. 
We knew the Pump-N-Spray would have a positive and significant impact on the families in Flint &#8212; particularly on the children. 
People, Planet, Profit. No matter how “green” your product is, your operations have to be sustainable and/or profitable. 
Always try and make people’s lives better with whatever you do and always listen to your customers. 
Try and partner with other entrepreneurs or institutions where possible. Together, everyone achieves more. Sometimes your products are more relevant to communities or countries not your own.

However, there are also threats to the environment and livelihoods that do not seem to be priority items for the government. 
But it's hard to make a judgement based on the financial constraints that we face and our current obligations. I would like to see more Jamaicans volunteering in their communities in green projects; and a greater effort to be made to teach our children in schools about the environment, “green” solutions to everyday issues and the impact of our current way of life on the environment. 
GV: In your opinion, are Jamaicans in general becoming more environmentally aware and more conscious of the impact of climate change? 
JE: Yes we are, as we have in recent times felt its impact in our homes. I am specifically talking about the drought of 2015, which left many households without running water, made us think more about our food security and helped improve the conditions for certain virus-carrying mosquitos to breed. 
Whether he's an inventor, a businessman, or both, Jovan Evans is certainly an example of the creativity and innovation badly needed to move forward Jamaica's "green economy". 
All Holds Barred in Cage 'Fight' Between Two Kazakhs &middot; Global Voices 
The reason for that, as learned by RFE/RL and a host of local Kazakh news websites, was that the two Kazakhs did not want to harm one another. 
The display of brotherliness, which saw some light grappling but none of the destructive knee, kick and punch combinations for which the sport is famous, did not impress the judges, who promptly disqualified the pair. 
A video from the fight is below: 
One of the fighters, Aibek Nurseit, told RFE/RL: 
Gabit and I, we both made it to the finals. I had beaten a French fighter and Gabit beat a Ukrainian guy. We never agreed beforehand that we wouldn't hit each other. when I entered the ring and the fight started, I felt immediately like Gabit was avoiding hitting me. I understood that he didn't want to fight with me, and I couldn't raise my hand against another Kazakh either. 
RFE/R'L's report continues: 
Nurseit said a large sum of money and a championship title were at stake, but he didn't want to win them by beating a fellow Kazakh. "I met Gabit after the fight at the banquet. We shook hands and that was it," he said. 
Thanks a lot lads, good work. 
You did us proud! Gabit Turganbek is one of 1.5 million ethnic Kazakhs hailing from China's western Xinjiang province. Kazakhs are the most populous Central Asian minority living in the province bar the Uighurs (est. 
8.5 million), while Kyrgyz, Uzbeks and Tajiks also live in the region. Ethnic Kazakhs make up over 65% of the population of ex-Soviet Kazakhstan, with around a fifth of the state's population made up of ethnic Russians. 
What Do People Tweet While Waiting for the Train to Go By? &middot; Global Voices 
Shakuji Park Crossing, Seibu Ikebukuro Line, Tokyo. Screencap from YouTube user hitorikamonen. 
By some estimates there are more than 3,000 kilometers of train lines snaking across Tokyo, giving Japan's capital city the highest railway density on the planet. 
While this makes rail transportation easy and convenient for Tokyo residents, the 34,000 level rail crossings (踏切, fumikiri) in Tokyo can make for some long waits for motorist, cyclists and pedestrians alike. 
One member of the prominent Japanese Internet meme-sharing community Matome Naver has curated a popular post about Tweets people send out while waiting for the train go by that captures different people's takes on one of the capital's most widely-shared experiences. 
So, how was your train wait today? 
Some people take to reporting unusual or amusing things they see while waiting for the train to pass. 
At the crossing waiting for the train to go by. People are lined up quite politely behind a horse. 
Waiting for the level crossing gates to pull back up gives some a chance to observe their surroundings more closely. 
Waiting for the train, I see a cat appear by my side... 
Others choose to escape the mundanity by diving into a book. 
The train schedules have converged in a perfect storm and the level crossing gates haven't opened in over 15 minutes. So I'm just reading a book. And others engage in people-watching. 
There's a train stopped near the level crossing, so the crossing gate has descended. 
The level crossing gates are down, so I thought I would take a detour. 
However I failed miserably and now I have scraped my toes. 
I guess I should just not try to climb over a wall next time. 
Usually whenever I have to wait at this level crossing, I try taking a detour along a slightly longer route. And I get lost every time. Sometimes people encounter rare trains: 
Wow, it's the Red Rapide (at the level crossing near my house)! 
I was planning to go into town and I realized I forgot my phone... 
And by chance I saw this train! 
It's morning, I'm waiting at the crossing and I discover this cute paw print. Yesterday I saw a rainbow above the level train crossing.

In many parts of Africa and Asia, the mainstream concept of beauty is often associated with lighter-skinned woman. Skin-whitening cosmetics are a multi-billion dollar industry, and their products support the idea that lightening dark skin is both achievable and preferable. 
The ‪#‎UnfairAndLovely campaign is challenging that. The hashtag gained momentum on different social media like Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr, inspiring women to celebrate their darker skin. It began in the United States with a photo shoot, Pax Jones behind the camera and sisters Mirusha and Yanusha Yogarajah, whose parents are from Sri Lanka, modelling. All three are University of Texas students. 
They shared the photos online with the hashtag #UnfairAndLovely to challenge the idea that "fair" (as seen in the name of the popular Fair and Lovely skin-lightening cream) means more beautiful. 
The campaign then took off. Jones, who is black, said in an interview, “I wanted to explore how overly colorism translates into a global phenomenon, and how that impacted others from ethnic backgrounds different from my own.” 
My friend's mom used to do this and it made me so sad. There's beauty in all shades #unfairandlovely⚡️https://t.co/UYCSI8p40U — Count VanDerMattson (@VanDerMattson) February 28, 2016 There have been other movements in the past against colorism. 
In India, a petition against Indian cosmetics company Emami called on them to withdraw a particularly discriminatory advert for Fair and Handsome cream. Another campaign called Dark is Beautiful (see Global Voices report) in 2013 pushed back against the idea that dark skin is somehow uglier or inferior. 
The African nation Côte d'Ivoire also banned skin-whitening creams, citing concern over lasting damage to health. 
For #‎UnfairAndLovely, many women shared selfies on Twitter with the hashtag:

Indian YouTube star The Techy Tantrika uploaded this video in support of the campaign, sharing some of her own struggles. 
In the video, she criticizes the Eurocentric idea of beauty: "I don't understand this concept of wanting to look like a different race. It doesn't make sense to me." 
Pax Jones told the Huffington Post that the campaign is "meant to be an inclusive space": 
It is for the dark-skinned queer, trans, genderqueer, non-binary, poor, fat, differently abled people of colour. 
#UnfairAndLovely has teamed up with an existing campaign #ReclaimTheBindi to encourage South Asians to take pride in their culture and bring attention to the issue of colorism. The Reclaim the Bindi Week is taking place between March 8 to 14. 
This article by Isis Madrid originally appeared on PRI.org on April 1, 2016, and is republished here as part of a content-sharing agreement. 
But she felt uninspired by the work, and decided to branch into film. 
"The things I saw in the ward left me forever changed. 
When you are in that situation you have two options, you could either return to the comfort of your own life or you could try and make someone else’s life comfortable." 
The pioneering Delhiite, 23, now dedicates her life to helping acid attack survivors. She founded Make Love Not Scars in 2014 to support victims, who are mostly women. 
And on March 7, she launched the first-ever rehabilitation center of its kind in India to extend services to survivors of acid attacks. 
Providing access to yoga, poetry and a range of emotional support, the center is a place Sharma hopes women recovering from attacks will feel comfortable. 
In addition to providing a safe space for local women to bond as they receive treatment, training and support from professionals, the center is equipped with sleeping quarters for survivors who come from out of town. Make Love Not Scars also offers vocational training, workshops in what Sharma calls "life coping skills," legal advice, and mental health services. 
Acid attacks are a problem all around the world, but particularly in India. 
There, an estimated 1,000 acid attacks are reported by women each year, often at the hands of a spurned suitor or disapproving family member. Most women don't report the incidents, however, and Acid Survivors Trust International says that the actual number is much higher. 
A liter of acid, available to anyone at stores across the country, costs as little as 33 cents in India. 
When possible, MLNS also appeals to the Indian government to provide free treatment. Last month Sharma was awarded the British Council International Alumni Award by the mayor of London. 
But the path to esteem was anything but simple for Sharma and her co-workers. Early on, she fought against ageism and patriarchal values that demeaned her ability to succeed. 
" we struggled to be taken seriously," she explains. 
"It was hard to get people to believe in our vision, because, at the end of the day no one wants to trust individuals that young with their money." 
Two years later, Sharma and her organization have gained international acclaim from the likes of the New York Times; teamed up with advertising heavyweights Ogilvy &amp; Mather to design and mount billboards across Mumbai calling for a ban on selling acid; and now find themselves attracting big ticket donations from corporations. 
But Sharma still experiences ageism. 
"It's a constant struggle for me," she says. 
"I prefer to take calls before I actually agree to a meeting because I don’t want people to judge me by my age or appearance." 
The MLNS center is a point of pride for Sharma, and not just because she fought so hard to open it. 
"I feel really good about the direction we are heading in," says Sharma. "I think the existence of such a center is going to be extremely instrumental towards changing the lives and future of acid attack survivors." 
In ten years, Sharma hopes to see no need for the organization that she's fought so hard to establish. Her dream? By then, survivors will have gained the tools to live productive, independent lives — and acid attacks will have all but disappeared from the cultural sphere. 
Chacha the Chimp Escaped a Zoo in Japan. 
After escaping from the Yagiyama Zoo in Sendai, in northeastern Japan, Chacha the chimp took refuge on top of a power pole. 
After being struck by a tranquilizer dart at close range, the infuriated animal lunged at two workers, just narrowly missing them. 
A chimpanzee was captured atop power lines in a residential neighbourhood after escaping from the Sendai City zoo. 
The massive effort to capture the chimpanzee was broadcast on live television in Japan. As they waited for the tranquilizer dart to take effect crews stood by at street level to cushion the chimpanzee's fall from atop its perch. Unfortunately for the chimpanzee they misjudged where the animal would fall, and it landed on the pavement. 
Caption: Escaped chimpanzee captured. 
According to the local Kahoku Shimpo news outlet, the chimpanzee is recovering after its fall. 
The Sendai zoo also provides no updates about Chacha on its web page devoted to the zoo's chimpanzee exhibit. 
In Japan, it is common for zoo and municipal workers to participate in training on how to capture escaped animals. This training may have helped in the capture of the chimpanzee. 
Video title: Zebra escapes after earthquake? Bloggers Shine a Light on Latin America’s Unreported, Underappreciated Scientific Innovations &middot; Global Voices 
How much does the news media cover scientific advances in Latin America? The bloggers at the online project Ciencia latina ("Latin Science") say it's not enough. As much in the regional media as in the international, the presence of Latin America in the world better known as scientific progress is still limited. 
News of corruption and government changes abound, but you don't hear much about the new observations made by Chilean astronomers, or the study in Yucatán, Mexico, that is bringing us closer to the causes of the dinosaurs' disappearance. Under the hashtag #CienciaLatina, there's an initiative to spread scientific news on networks created by scientists of the region. 
Its objective is to create and expand a network of scientific blogs and to contribute to efforts to spread scientific knowledge. The idea behind Ciencia latina is that this information needs to reach the general public in colloquial, familiar language, so that it can also be part of the discoveries and innovations shared throughout the world. On its blog, Ciencia latina explains: 
La Red Latinoamericana de Blogs de Ciencia was born with the purpose of gathering the efforts of scientific disclosure carried out by bloggers from diverse Latin American countries that, with their distinct disciplines and interests, try to replace the value of science in social networks. 
By creating these websites, they demonstrate that science is not impossible to undertake in Latin America, despite the difficulties in terms of resources that many research institutions experience. In fact, in the last decade, there have been substantial improvements in investigative capacities and indicators in the majority of countries in the region. 
Brazil, for example, leads the region in the raw numbers, both in the size of its budget dedicated to research and development and in number of publications. Argentina has a formidable number of researchers in relation to its total population (three researchers for every 1,000 workers—a figure higher than China's). 
Chile, on the other hand, is the leader in protection of intellectual property, holding the greatest number of patents registered per year. Using the label #CienciaLatina, the network also helps promote and broadcast specific local scientific works with global impact, and it works to dedicate websites to boosting scientific literacy in the region, ideally making the region's scientific advances more visible around the world. 
In doing so, the bloggers hope to capture the attention of both young and old Latin Americans. Recruiting more scientists could create a critical mass of scholars and researchers, too, who might start making more demands of national authorities, insisting on better research in state projects, and better data in state development plans. 
The network and its news can also be followed at RedLBC's Twitter account and the hashtag #CienciaLatina. 
These White Butterflies from Nepal are Spreading a Message of Hope and Social Change Throughout the World &middot; Global Voices 
A boy looks on from an old abandoned vehicle installed with white butterflies. Image from the Facebook page of the White Butterfly project. Used with permission. 
White means peace and these white butterflies from Nepal are spreading their wings all over the world, carrying a message of peace, hope and social change wherever they flutter. 
It all started when Nepalese artist Milan Rai let the butterflies loose in the streets of Kathmandu, mostly at old, dilapidated and forgotten locations such as tree stumps, but also on busy streets and famous landmarks. 
According to Rai, butterflies, as symbols of metamorphosis, represent transformation and hope. 
Rai says the idea for the art installations struck him when a real white butterfly landed on his paintbrush as he was planning a more complicated art project. 
Thus his own white butterflies began their journey. 
The paper cut-out creatures have evoked strong emotions and empathy for Rai's cause among visitors to his diverse installations. 
Recently, he installed 9,000 white butterflies at the premises of Kathmandu’s Kalmochan Temple in memory of around 9,000 people killed by the April earthquake last year. 
The temple was completely destroyed by the earthquake. 
Earlier, he had installed the butterflies under the bridge of the Bagmati River in Kathmandu, expressing hope for the holy river's liberation from uncontrolled pollution. 
People of all walks of life are coming together to clean this holy river as part of an ongoing environmental campaign.

This 'butterfly effect' has attracted and inspired people from around the world and many have asked him for more butterflies. 
In his recent Facebook post, he wrote: 
Verena came to visit my studio and took 500 white butterflies with her. 
She is going to a village called Ghyachchok - the epicenter of earthquake from 11-13 Baisakh. She is taking white butterflies for this community. 
Now the butterflies have travelled across the globe, where they have been widely photographed. His butterflies were seen with children, adults, elders and activists coming together in Brussels to save a park, for instance.

High-school drop-out Rai has shared his personal story in Portrait of an Artist - Milan Rai uploaded on Vimeo by Kathmandu-based filmmaker Shashank Shrestha. 
Recently, he was invited to Harvard University where he talked about his project and installed his famous protagonists in different parts of the famous institution: 
Two days ago, I had a meeting with Harvard Divinity school Buddhist ministry students. It was a heart warming experience to share my creative journey with the the Professors and students. 
I mostly talked about my personal transformation and how a tiny butterfly changed my life. After that we went to spread white butterflies in other departments.

A crowdsourced photo blogging website, Featured Collectives, encourages submissions from photographers who capture the day-to-day of Myanmar's ordinary people. 
Photographer Chit Min Maung, who is running the site, told Global Voices that the online project is intended to showcase the creativity of Myanmar's photographers and link them to the international community. He said: 
In Myanmar, we usually shoot landscapes and portraits and we don't make much choices. So, we wanted to show that we still have different types of photography other than those two. 
Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, was under military dictatorship for more than 50 years until it transitioned to constitutional democracy in 2010. During the military rule, Myanmar largely remained detached from the rest of the world, preserving a unique culture and way of life. 
Last year, the opposition defeated the military-backed party in a historic election that could usher in a new era in Myanmar society. 
As Myanmar prepares to pursue more reforms in the next few months, websites like Featured Collectives are essential in documenting everyday life in a rapidly changing society. 
The photoblog features photo essays and individual photos submitted by photographers from both inside and outside the country.

Image taken from this tweet by @MonedasColombia. 
Are you a fan of numismatics, otherwise known as the study or collection of money? If the answer is yes, then the Twitter account Monedas de Colombia (Colombian Coins) is one worth following. 
From the city of Bucaramanga, the owner of the account, which has over 7,000 followers, tweets historical facts in Spanish about coins and banknotes from this South American country. 
According to the International Association of Currency Affairs, Colombian coins were the world's most beautiful in 2013. 
500 peso coin in homage to the Tree of Guacarí and the efforts of the municipality to preserve it. 
In addition, this public account publishes facts about coins and bills from other countries around the world. 
However, its main focus is on the large Colombian collection minted and released throughout the country's history. 
A dog as the image of the 25 peso bill released by the Colombian National Bank in 1895.

Animals Can't Escape Cambodia's Worst Drought in 50 Years, Either &middot; Global Voices

The El Niño weather phenomenon is partly responsible for plaguing Cambodia with rising temperatures and water shortages. The extreme drought is reported to be the worst in the past 50 years. 
According to the government, 2.5 million Cambodians in 100 districts have been affected by the drought, and water shortages have been declared in 18 of the country’s 25 provinces. 
Meanwhile, nine provinces are experiencing heat waves. 
Low water supplies have exacerbated poverty in many rural areas, where farmers depend on rivers and ponds for irrigation. 
Food security and local populations' health are also growing concerns. 
Animals are dying because of the water shortage and heat stroke. 
A tourist elephant in Angkor succumbed to heat stroke. 
Because of this incident, some Internet users launched a petition urging the authorities to end elephant rides, which are still popular among tourists. The Cambodian government is asking for cooperation and unity in the nation's response to the drought crisis. 
Officials vow to provide immediate aid to residents experiencing water shortages. A Visual Journey Into the Floating Guava Markets of Bangladesh &middot; Global Voices 
Used with permission 
Thousands of farmers earn their livelihood growing and selling these guavas. 
Farmers and wholesalers gather in several floating markets in a region that resembles the floating market of Thailand. Guava, a berry-like fruit, is often called the "apple of the tropics". Although it originated in tropical America (in the land between Mexico and Peru), today it is one of the important fruit crops of Bangladesh, where it's grown all over the country. 
The southern region of Bangladesh—especially districts of Barisal, Pirojpur, and Jhalokathi—are the main Guava-producing areas. 
It comes to life during the Guava season, which is from July to August. 
Other fruits, like Hog Plum lemons, coconuts, and bananas, are also sold in the markets throughout the year. 
The farmers don't have proper communication or cold-storage facilities, resulting in poor market prices, but the proliferation of mobile phones is changing this scenario. 
“Journey to Bangladesh” uploaded a video on Youtube showing the floating markets and guava gardens in Barisal backwaters. 
Photographer Md. Moyazzem Mostakim shares dozens of wonderful photos of the floating market on his Facebook page, Timur Photography, which has gained viral appeal online.

Twitter Provides a Treasure Trove of Photos of China and Japan During World War II &middot; Global Voices 
Chungking, China's wartime capital during 1937-1945, here in 1944 and in colour. Posted by Twitter user @chinarhyming. 
Two Twitter accounts are a constant source of insightful photographs of World War II in Asia. 
The account China in WW2 focuses on the war in China that started in September 1931 with Japan's annexation of Manchuria. Another Twitter account, WW2 in Asia, is dedicated to "Livetweeting about history, exactly 80 years after it happened" until 2025 and the eightieth anniversary of the end of the war. 
China in WW2 
According to its profile, China in WW2 provides "news about the 1931-1945 Sino-Japanese war and the birth of modern Asia." The account is managed by Peter Harmsen, author of the books 'Shanghai 1937' and 'Nanjing 1937'. 
The Twitter account provides images of a long war that has largely been forgotten in both Japan and in the West, despite lasting nearly 15 years until Japan's defeat in 1945. Cover of Japanese kids' magazine from 1934.

The images provide a fascinating glimpse into the world of the 1930s, and point out how, for much of the decade, Japan interacted and collaborated with Western powers while at war in China.

While many of the images appear to be posed, there are some stunning documentary finds:

WW2 in Asia 
Twitter account WW2 in Asia aims to provide a live-tweet retrospective of the war in Asia. It's also an excellent source of rare and surprising photos. 
Much of the appeal of the microblog is that photos are tweeted chronologically in "real-time"; right now the account is tweeting the events of May 1936: 
May 11, 1936: New Japanese law to make disclosure of industrial information an act of treason pic.twitter.com/qImZk2dleO — WW2 in Asia (@asiainww2) May 11, 2016 
The tweets provide some useful context for what was happening as Asia marched towards war:

The Twitter account presents some interesting perspectives on the Japan and Asia of 80 years ago:

Another somewhat depressing but compelling feature of the Twitter account is that it demonstrates that the world was not taken completely by surprise by the eruption of war:

In São Paulo, it's no different: street artists bring color and life to its grey landscape. But while murals from central neighborhoods like Vila Madalena are featured in international travel books, those from low-income suburbs remain unknown, even for the city's residents &#8212; who amount to some 20 million people. 
With this in mind, reporters from Agência Mural compiled the best of street art in their respective neighborhoods &#8212; in Brazil they're called quebradas &#8212; all located in lower-income neighborhoods.

Pictures of Myanmar's landmarks photoshopped to include litter in the foreground have gone viral among Facebook users in the country. The images, which highlight the worsening garbage problem in Myanmar's famous tourism destinations, were created by artist Si Thu Aung, who encouraged people to share them to raise awareness about the need to protect the country's landmarks. 
Garbage pollution is a concern raised by many experts, who urge Myanmar to embrace a more sustainable model of development. Even Nobel Laureate and top government minister Aung San Suu Kyi led a nationwide garbage collection campaign at the end of 2015 to demonstrate the urgency of addressing the problem. 
The photos were uploaded to Facebook by Si Mon, who explained how picking up litter can uplift the image of the country: 
Now foreign visitors are coming because of the political change and it's time for you to show the beauty of the country to the world by being clean and organized. If you set an example by by being careful with where you throw away your trash, we can raise the standards of our country.

A Feisty 12-Year-Old Shows Us What Life in Nepal Is Like After the Earthquake &middot; Global Voices 
Shreesha Duwal doing chores at the temporary camp in Bhaktapur where she and her family moved after their house was destroyed in the 2015 earthquake in Nepal. 
This article by Sonia Narang originally appeared on PRI.org on April 21, 2016, and is republished here as part of a content-sharing agreement. 
When Shreesha Duwal takes me to her family home in Bhaktapur, outside Kathmandu, there’s just a gaping hole and piles of bricks. The multi-story building collapsed during last year’s earthquake. 
Listen to this story on PRI.org &raquo; 
“There were 20 houses here, all 20 of them have been destroyed,” she says. 
“It pains my heart to stand here. 
It hurts to see everyone else’s houses gone too.” 
Books and clothes, including many of her school uniforms, are buried under the rubble. Now she lives with her mother, father, brother, and grandfather in a one-room tin shack, in a camp for the displaced that houses 60 families. Almost a year has gone by since a 7.8-magnitude earthquake destroyed towns and villages across Nepal, on April 25, 2015. 
Nepal's government has not yet approved plans for the reconstruction of homes. In Shreesha's camp, there's no running water and they have to cook outside, making dinner in the dark by the light of the fire. The walls are made of corrugated metal sheets with a tarp for a roof. 
“We have killed so many already,” she says. “But no matter how many we kill, it seems like we have the same amount of rats.” 
There’s no escape from the weather either. 
“It’s very hot in here,” she says. “During storms, the wind blows the dust inside and makes everything dirty in our small room. When it rains, water leaks inside.” 
As a kid, she’s most annoyed by the fact that the TV doesn’t work properly. 
“Only half of the screen lights up when we try to watch TV,” she says. “So, I think, what’s even the point?” 
Shreesha is a bright, confident eighth grader, but she finds it hard to study with the never-ending construction noise across the street. 
When she’s at school, the other kids taunt her for being homeless. 
“You don’t even have a house to live in,” they say. “How are you living in one room?” 
The camp for people displaced by the earthquake is meant to be temporary, but the government has been slow in doling out funds for reconstruction. Ironically, Shreesha’s father is a construction worker who spends his days building other people’s homes. What little money he earns, he puts toward school fees for his kids. 
“I think we will have to stay here for a long time to come,” Shreesha says.

A few days after I meet Shreesha, I join her extended family for the Nepali New Year. 
They take me up to a tiny, dark room on the third floor of an abandoned building next to their old house. 
It’s rickety and the floor shakes when anyone walks, but they’re determined to celebrate somewhere outside of the camp. 
When I ask Shreesha what keeps her going, her answer is straightforward. “It is the dream of having my own house one day, and my own room, that gives me the strength,” she tells me. 
After the New Year’s meal, Shreesha, her dad, and cousins lead me through a maze of historical alleyways full of festivities near her old house. We try some of Bhaktapur’s famous “King Curd,” a delicious sweet yogurt, and stop at a temple ceremony to listen to the music. 
In this moment, Shreesha seems really happy.

This is neither an April Fools’ joke nor a viral Internet hoax. 
On March 30, 2016, the Philippine National Academy of Science and Technology (NAST) posted on Facebook a photo from 1954 of Filipino engineer Gregorio Y. Zara demonstrating his latest invention: a two-way television telephone, or videophone, patented as a "photo phone signal separator network." 
The post quickly became popular especially among Filipino Internet users, who appreciated learning that a Filipino invented a videophone as early as the 1950s. Here’s the full caption of the Facebook photo: 
Aha! National Scientist Gregorio Y. Zara, a physicist, invented a device that makes it possible for two persons to see each other on a television while talking on the telephone as early as 1954. 
NAST is an advisory body in the Philippine government that deals with science and technology. One of its mandates is to recognize outstanding achievements by Filipinos in science and technology. 
Most of the reactions on social media praised Zara's pioneering achievement in building a videophone. 
Many students know Zara as an important Filipino scientist, but only few remember that one of his inventions was an early prototype of a gadget that we came to know as a videophone. 
Other social media users have seen the story as evidence that the country's previous governments failed to support the work of scientists and visionaries like Zara. 
There is no clear explanation as to why Zara’s videophone didn’t reach the commercial market, but one commenter noted that the transmission used by the machine is the same as broadcasting a live television. Hence, it was “expensive and impractical.” 
Zara died in 1978, but his legacy lives on every time a Filipino overseas worker connects with his or her family in the Philippines using an Internet videophone. 
How Beauty Trends Have Changed in Japan Over the Past 100 Years &middot; Global Voices 
Screenshot from Watchcut Video YouTube profile. 
Watchcut has added Japan to its ongoing video series "100 Years of Beauty," providing a fascinating look at how beauty trends for women have changed in Japan over the last century. 
Junko &amp; Marina Taylor provided the research for the video, and many of their notes are documented on Pinterest. 
They've also provided a video explaining the "research behind the looks": 
Manual scavenging is illegal in India but the practice continues to exist. 
This woman in the Moradabad district of Uttar Pradesh carries human waste for disposal. Image courtesy UNICEF India. About one billion people, or 15 percent of the global population, practice open defecation and a large portion of them are in India. Much of the poor hygiene practiced in India is deeply influenced by the country's discriminatory caste system. 
According to a report by the Asian Human Rights Commission in 2015, however, many rural households in India continue to engage in manual scavenging, finding that the continued practice has less to do with poverty than with enduring caste-based discrimination. Sanjay Kumar Chaudhary writes at Countercurrents: 
They are found in almost all cities of India—where they sweep the streets and manually engage in carrying night-soil. 
Further, it causes various health problems, those who engage in this work being exposed to the most virulent forms of viral and bacterial infections that affect their skin, eyes, limbs, respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. 
A ground report produced by the international media and human rights organisation Video Volunteers reveals that the practice continues unabated in Gujarat, which earlier declared itself free from manual scavenging. 
As per the Video Volunteers report: 
When visual evidence was presented to Charuben Mori, the Chief Executive Officer of the Dhangadra Municipality, she refused to take cognizance of it and said, “We don’t endorse or promote illegal practices such as manual scavenging.” On being asked why safai karmacharis weren’t provided safety gear, Mori refused to take responsibility and instead, shifted the blame onto the contractors saying, “These are not our employees so we do not know about their working conditions. They are employed by the contractors”. The law is clear that a person cannot be directly or indirectly (under contract) employed for unprotected cleaning of sewers. 
Activists have launched a petition urging the government of Gujarat to take punitive action against the officials responsible. 
Making of an eco cooler. 
Screenshot from YouTube Video 
Many of the houses do not have electricity to run affordable cooling devices, such as ceiling fans. A new social venture has come up with a simple idea to provide a cheap solution to the problem. 
Grey Dhaka, the Bangladesh wing of New-York-based advertising agency Grey, and the Grameen Intel Social Business, a social business information technology company created in 2009 by Grameen Trust and Intel, teamed up to create the Eco-Cooler. 
This is amazing! 
Bangladesh’s #EcoCooler that runs w/out electricity could be the answer to rising heat https://t.co/NYUNHGtb5w @YourStoryCo — Nileena (@nileenags) May 24, 2016 The Eco-Cooler is made of cardboard and used plastic bottles, which are ubiquitous in Bangladesh. 
Holes are cut in a grid from the cardboard, with plastic bottles fitted into the holes. 
(The bottoms of the bottles are removed, before this step.) 
This technology is very simple. 
Internet users can download the design for free and make an Eco-Cooler at home. 
The following video explains the process: 
Sambeet Chakraborty writes on Facebook: An amazingly simple idea..making lives better for millions in Bangladesh. 
A.R. Mashrur Hasan Mukut says: 
Absolutely Brilliant idea!! so easy and simple to execute!! we all should spread this idea out among those who need this !! Instructions to make the eco-cooler is available in its website 
The first prototype was installed in March 2015 and it was ready for launch by February 2016. Eco-Coolers have been installed for free in thousands of homes as a part of corporate social responsibility program in villages in Nilphamari, Daulatdia, Paturia, Modonhati, and Khaleya across Bangladesh. 
The raw materials are easily available everywhere, and Eco-Coolers can be a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly cooling solution in many countries across the world. 
There don’t seem to be any independent reviews of how well the eco-cooler works easily available online, but if you’ve built or tested one, let us know. 
Let Kyrgyzstan's Issyk-Kul Region Inspire You &middot; Global Voices 
Flickr image uploaded by Maximus Shoots. 
The sapphire-blue 'eye' of Kyrgyzstan's Tien-Shan mountains and the rugged landscapes that surround it have long been a favoured destination for holiday-makers in the former Soviet Union. Now they have an appropriate promotional video. 
Issyk-Kul, an eastern region of Kyrgyzstan that is home to the second largest mountain lake in the world behind Lake Titicaca, continues to be most loved for its beaches and chill waters during the wafer-thin swimming season stretching from early July to early September. 
But as a video produced by a Kazakhstan-based creative collective creative Photosafari.KZ shows, there is much more to the region than that, particularly if you are on two wheels. Enjoy! 
How a Self-Taught Translator Created a Literary Masterpiece One Word at a Time &middot; Global Voices 
This article originally appeared on PRI.org on May 18, 2016, and is republished here as part of a content-sharing agreement. 
The Man Booker International Prize for Fiction came out this week, and South Korean writer Han Kang got the brass ring for her novel "The Vegetarian." It's about a woman who believes she is turning into a tree. 
It's also pretty erotic. But the thing many people are talking about isn't the book itself. It's the translator. 
Listen to this story on PRI.org &raquo; 
Deborah Smith, the 28-year-old Brit behind the novel's masterful translation to English, only started learning Korean six years ago. 
So how did she manage to interpret the book so well? "If you're asking for the secret, I'm afraid I'm as ignorant as you are," she says. 
"Looking back now it feels like I must have looked up almost every other word in the dictionary. That's probably an exaggeration, but that's what it felt like at the time. 
Plus, with literature, direct translations don't always work best. "Just because it's the literal equivalent doesn't mean it's the right word to use if you are aiming for some kind of literary effect," she says. 
The book's prose holds up in English, but it also passes a much harder test: Smith says that people who speak both fluent Korean and English cannot tell that a non-native speaker did the translation. 
"Nobody has really commented on that from having read it," she says. "People certainly talk about it from hearing my story from other channels. But the strength of the translation and the skill of a literary translation is how well you know the target language, not really how well you know the source language." The key, according to Smith, was really knowing English and how to use it to recreate the Korean novel's style and voice. 
"So on that end, I was pretty confident." "The Vegetarian" was unlike any other book Smith had read, and she was the one who approached a publisher back in 2013 about doing a translation. "I think it's one of those books where you can really see what is exciting about contemporary Korean literature. 
It is quite distinctive from a lot of other countries' ," she says. And that's the big reason she chose to tackle a project in a language she spoke imperfectly. 
"I think that is kind of the point of translation, to make something available in a language or a culture that is new and that wasn't there before."

Porters carrying the first car to the Kathmandu Valley. 
Image via Twitter/NepalInPix Throughout history, Nepal has represented a land of mysticism to travellers from abroad. Nepal’s high Himalayas with the world’s highest mountains, the mid-hills and valleys abundant with rare rituals and traditions, and the southern plains with dense forest and wild animals have always attracted curious visitors to this landlocked country. 
Though Nepal is not untouched by modern development, images from only few decades ago take you to a different world. 
The Twitter account Nepal in Pix publishes images from that era, providing an idea of what life was like not that long ago.

Singaporeans Are Urged to Eat Less Rice, As Fears Grow About Links to Diabetes &middot; Global Voices A bowl of white rice in a restaurant in Singapore.

Singapore’s Health Promotion Board (HPB) is urging people to eat healthier varieties of rice because it claims white rice could be worse than sugary drinks as a potential cause of diabetes. 
Rice, a staple food in the country and most parts of Asia, accounts for one-third of Singaporeans' average calorie intake, while sugary canned drinks make up a mere 3.5 percent. 
The newspaper the Straits Times reported on the HPB report on May 6, featuring an infographic showing that a bowl of rice has twice the carbohydrate content of a soft drink. 
This piece of news generated an intense online discussion, with many criticizing the board for waging a campaign against rice instead of focusing on sugar, unhealthy drinks, and other processed foods. Many also added that it’s misleading to blame rice for causing diabetes, reminding the HPB that Singaporeans and majority of Asians have been eating rice for thousands of years. 
The writer Richard Seah raised a similar point: 
Rice and other grains have been eaten by humans as their main food for over 10,000 years. 
The former journalist Ian Tan said he thinks it’s irresponsible to publish stories with sensationalist headlines and confusing infographics: Now that there is news or talk that rice is bad for you, many people will just go to the extreme and stop eating rice. 
Then when their health goes awry, they blame everything but their hysteria, ignorance and inability to think or research for themselves. Don’t even start considering such silly ideas like substituting soft drinks for rice, despite what a newspaper infographic may imply. 
You will just get fatter and dead faster than you’ve ever feared. 
Reacting to the online debate about rice versus sugar, the HPB clarified that it’s not asking people to stop eating rice or that rice alone is the cause of diabetes. 
It said it merely advised the public that eating less white rice reduces the risk of diabetes. The HPB also recommended consuming brown rice as a healthier alternative. But some commented on social media that brown rice is more expensive, which could discourage poorer households from buying it. 
Colorful, Human-Powered Rickshaws Rule the Road in Bangladesh's Capital Dhaka &middot; Global Voices 
Rickshaws in Dhaka. Image by blackthorne57 used under Creative Commons license (CC BY-NC 2.0) 
Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, is known as the city of mosques and the city of the Mughal architecture. 
Being one of the most populated cities in the world &#8212; with the bumper-to-bumper traffic to prove it &#8212; Dhaka also has another identity: the city of rickshaws. 
These passenger vehicles, which are pedaled by a driver, are everywhere in Dhaka. 
There are an estimated 600,000 rickshaws in the city, though less than 100,000 are licensed. Compare that to the 37 rickshaws on the roads in Dhaka in 1941. 
Dhaka, home to mostly flat roads and narrow lanes, does not have enough public transportation for everyone. Rickshaws rule here as the fare is comparatively low. 
Here is a short documentary on YouTube uploaded by Abstract Films, which follows three different rickshaw drivers through the streets of Dhaka as they talk about their lives and the challenges of the profession. 
Rickshaws came to Bangladesh in the early 1930s. Till the early 1970s, rickshaws were the common mode of transportation in Dhaka. Even today, this inexpensive, environment friendly, non-polluting form of transportation is a way of life for thousands of people. Currently, 40% people commute in the city by rickshaw. 
In the early days of rickshaws, they were left more or less undecorated. Sometime in the 1960s decorative motifs on the back of the rickshaws began to appear. 
This decoration is now a staple of urban art. Film stars, landscape, animals, contemporary political affairs, pictures and even Osama Bin Laden add color to the city's transportation. This Facebook page titled "Rickshaw Paint/Art of Bangladesh" highlights different colourful rickshaw motifs found across Dhaka. 
Rickshaw paintings have also been used as protest. The art is not limited to just rickshaws, either. It is also an increasingly popular theme in fashion, with rickshaw motifs now found on saris, shalwar kameez and kurtis.

Here's one photo of it:

Two digital journalists based in Makassar, in the region of South Sulawesi, Indonesia were attacked on June 5, 2016, while attending an event held by Makassar branch of Islamic Students Alumni (KAHMI Makassar) at Makassar mayor's house. 
Global Voices author Arpan Rachman and his wife Icha Lamboge, who is also a journalist, told Global Voices that two men in black uniforms – not the standard uniform of city security guards – stopped them and asked for their journalist ID cards. The men then took them into a small room behind the house where Arpan asked them to identify themselves, which they refused to do. 
One of the men then snatched Lamboge's mobile phone, which is her main reporting tool. 
When Rachman intervened and tried to get her phone back, the man grabbed punched him in the chest while the other man strangled him. 
The couple reported the incident to police, and Rachman was examined by a doctor. 
He is recovering from the incident, however, both he and his wife are fearing for their safety. The Alliance for Independent Journalists in Makassar has documented 12 cases of journalist abuse thus far in 2016, including harassment while reporting, destruction of reporting tools, intimidation, and physical assault. Neither KAHMI, AJI, nor Makassar officials have issued any statement regarding the attack on Rachman and Lamboge. 
They continue to fear for their physical safety. Both work actively as journalists, with Lamboge working chiefly with SINDO Trijaya FM, a radio station based in Jakarta, and Rachman working as investigative journalist with multiple local news outlets including BaKTINews, inspiratifnews, Membunuh Indonesia and Media Lingkungan. 
The couple has worked together on stories that they suspect could have provoked the incident. For a recent print edition of the human rights magazine Torture: Asian and Global Perspectives, they wrote about controversial mass evictions taking place in the Bulogading zone at the center of Makassar. More than one online story about the evictions has been taken down as tensions have risen. 
In Indonesia, violence against journalist happens regularly. 
Attacks like these often go unreported in the media, and perpetrators often go without punishment. 
The case involving Arpan and Icha was covered by one local news website, but the story was subsequently removed for unknown reasons. Global Voices community condemns all forms of violence against journalists in Indonesia and elsewhere in the world. As a community, we stand by our colleague Arpan and his family's appeal for truth and justice. 
#MedeHollín: The Campaign Against Pollution That Changed the Name of a Colombian City &middot; Global Voices 
Published with permission. Since March 2016, the city of Medellín, Colombia, has been affected by air pollution. 
The environmental problem is caused by different factors, including the El Niño weather phenomenon, a rise in the number of car parks, and the geographic location of the city itself (located in a valley) which causes the smog to stay trapped between the mountains. 
Medellín, which has historically held the nickname of "City of Eternal Spring," was quickly and sarcastically renamed by web users #Medehollín, "hollín" meaning "soot" in English. Spanish-language Wikipedia defines soot as: 
It looks similar to ash, but blacker in tone. The incident caused such a stir, that one of the country's national newspapers, Revista Semana, published a piece explaining the origin of the hashtag. 
How the hashtag '#MedeHollín' came to be However, while some find it all amusing, the city's mayor, Federico Gutiérrez, was quick to issue a call to stop "degrading" Medellín by naming it as such: 
Ladies and Gentlemen @RevistaSemana, with all due respect, we are experiencing an environmental emergency. We are #Medellín NOT #Medehollín. We will get through this too. 
Citizen commentary ranges from calls to protect the environment, use of masks to protect yourself and opt for a bicycle, to the publication of up-to-date figures on the situation as its happening. 
Medellín responds 
Those living in Medellín like Juan Herrera thought that the problem is caused by a lack of care for their environment by the residents themselves: 
No need for words. #Medehollin I'm so sorry, these people don't love you as much as they say. 
Meanwhile, Daniel Urrea published a photo on Instagram reluctantly wearing a face mask: 
New toy. Not fun: very necessary. Indignation. #Medehollín 
Daniel Suárez shared that deaths due to respiratory causes in the city have increased: In #Medehollin deaths from respiratory illnesses are going up, caused by pollution. 
A Change.org petition is also channeling residents' responses to the situation. 
In the petition's explanation, its creator Pablo Montoya unpacked the environmental, economic, governmental and societal reasons which are behind the pollution crisis in Medellín: 
For me, one of the biggest reasons for this crisis, not only environmental but also social, is the large number of cars and motorbikes which come into Medellín and its neighbouring towns. It is a number which exceeds, by a long way, our capacity to deal with it. 
'Please don't make us live in Medehollín' 
By way of protest, face masks were added to various sculptures: I love this! 
The city is asking the mayor to make real and brave decisions. 
Similarly, some buses were stuck with a message: "Please don't make us live in Medehollín": 
#Medehollin is moving through the city. 
And the group SiCLas are campaigning to promote the use of bicycles: 
Get out the bikes, we don't have to live in #Medehollín. Let's go #PedallingThroughTheAir away from our polluted cities. 
Finally, the environmental emergency provoked a question: How do we think of current transportation in the city? 
A response came from the transport secretary by way of a tweet: "Our priority is: First the pedestrian, then cyclists, then public transport, and finally private vehicles." @FicoGutierrez 
In the face of high pollution levels on 1 and 2 April, the government has taken measures such as No Car Day, free entry on the city's metro system, and a halt on open-air activities. Although by the time this post was published, the environmental emergency was over, it is certain that the subject will have to be included on the public agenda in a permanent way, as Twitter user Kenny Valenzuela pointed out: 
@FicoGutierrez Look, We are still living in #MedeHollin measures cannot be temporary for a crisis that is already here. 
How El Niño Is Affecting the Upland Areas of Myanmar &middot; Global Voices

This article is from The Irrawaddy, an independent news website in Myanmar, and is republished on Global Voices as part of a content-sharing agreement. 
Shan State’s upland areas are typically cooler than the arid regions of central and lower Myanmar, although this year, much like the rest of the country, it has suffered from an unusually powerful El Niño weather pattern. 
In southern Shan State, springs and lakes used by local communities to store rainwater for domestic as well as farming purposes have been dry since February, leaving many villagers facing water shortages that are even worse than those in previous years. Tun Kyi, the head of Kalaw Township’s Le Gaung Village, explains the situation in their area: 
The lake near our village dried up two months ago. Last year, we were able to use water from there until March. 
To tackle water scarcity, some local charities, such as the Brighter Future Myanmar Foundation, have started to distribute drinking water to villages. The foundation, the only in Shan State digging wells in hard-hit areas, has been collaborating with Myanmar’s government since 2014, receiving machines to drill into the mainly limestone Shan plateau. The foundation says that it has recently spent US$1.5 million to buy their own new drilling equipment and that they have dug over 100 wells in Shan State to date.

Je suis pineapple, or I am pineapple. 
Via Mirana (with permission) 
When it comes to memes, pineapple is the new orange, at least in Madagascar. 
Social media in Madagascar has become quite pineapple-flavored over the past few days. Why the sudden fervor for the spiky fruit? Here is a bit of context on the current social situation on the Red Island. 
Madagascar came up as the world's poorest country in one of the poverty indices published by the World Bank (and reported by media outlets such as Radio France Internationale). The criticism of the economic status of the country did not sit well with the president of Madagascar. 
He challenged observers, local media and citizens to "provide evidence that the country was getting poorer." 
Malagasy netizens quickly obliged in a biting manner: Is this graph here not enough evidence Mr President ? #Madagascar #WASH 
Koolsaina, a Malagasy community blog, posted the following photo on its website: 
Via Koolsaina 
Following that first tense exchange between the president and Malagasy netizens, another Malagasy community website, Tananews, posted a photo of First Lady Voahangy Rajaonarimampianina wearing a a green dress with a pineapple motif on the front: 
The Malagasy president and the first lady at an independence day ceremony. 
Via Tananews Tananews added a link and a comment with a hint of sarcasm that said, "Indeed, not everyone is poor in Madagascar." The link showed that the dress was probably designed by high-end clothing brand Dolce &amp; Gabana that sold for US $7,745 on the website of department store Nieman Marcus (it is unclear whether that is the actually cost of the dress that the first lady was wearing). 
The outrage was swift on the Malagasy web. A flurry of memes with the hashtag #mananasy (pineapple) appeared within days on various Malagasy websites and social media. Here are a few memes that were widely shared: 
The meme reads, " Do you know how to wear Pineapple as they do in Antananarivo ? (play on word with a traditional folk song)" Used with permission. 
Beggar: "Can I have US $7,000 please?" First lady: "I have no pineapple for you." 
Via the POV Facebook page "New pineapple haircut because I want to be famous too." Via Rivo Francis on Facebook 
Via Aina Rakotoson on Facebook Tragically, all the jokes about pineapple came a few days after tragedy struck the country's independence day ceremony. 
Here is a video of the aftermath: The whole conversation on "Pineapple-Gate" comes at a time when a major bill on freedom of speech and ethics online is being prepared by Malagasy authorities. 
The early returns from insiders on how the bill will shape up hint that it will severely restrict free expression online and will include heavy fines for any materials deemed to be libel. The bill should be submitted to the parliament for approval in the coming weeks. Global Voices in Malagasy editor Andriamifidisoa Zo aka Jentilisa has contributed to this story with links and emails to the bloggers mentioned in this article. 
Technology, Engineering and Incredible Discoveries Mark the Panama Canal Expansion &middot; Global Voices 
Panama Canal, image on Flickr by user Jose Jiménez (CC BY-SA 2.0). 
On June 26, 2016, a day that Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela described as "historic for the nation," the expansion of the Panama Canal on the Atlantic Panamanian coast was inaugurated in the capital and in several provinces amidst national flags and the sound of music played by students and bands. 
The Panama Canal is a man-made waterway that connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean at the narrowest point of the Isthmus of Panama. It has a total length of 77 miles and was originally inaugurated on August 15, 1914. For over a hundred years this short and fairly cheap key conduit has sped up the economic and commercial exchange in the region. The recently opened expansion project took around ten years to complete. 
Chinese vessel Cosco Shipping Panama was the first ship that sailed through the newly extended Panama Canal, thus opening traffic into the new locks at Agua Clara at the Atlantic watershed. 
According to the official Panama Canal website, the decision to build a third transit lane came after thorough studies and analysis and it aimed to double its capacity. The website also shows the progress of the expansion program with graphics and includes photos and videos. 
On Twitter, users celebrated this new phase of the canal, which has shortened distances in the American continent. 
Some talked about the next project, whatever that may be: Go, Panama. 
Some others compared realities from different eras: 
The Panama Canal I visited is now a tiny little canal compared to what's being inaugurated today. 
There are also images of the Cosco Shipping Panama, the first ship that went through the expanded Canal: 
First vessel passes through expanded Panama Canal https://t.co/7e41673zAk pic.twitter.com/67j2qdq99F — News (@orbitcollection) 26 de junio de 2016 
A local outlet posted a video showing people gathered there, and the BBC recalled how the Canal changed the world: 
People at Cocolí waiting to witness Cosco Shipping Panama sailing through the expanded Canal. 
Five things that changed in the world with the Panama Canal. 
Hidden treasures 
During the decade the Panama Canal expansion works were taking place, more than 2,200 different archeological objects were found and classified, thus telling the commercial history of the isthmus of Panama since pre-Columbian times: 
Teeth, daggers, chimneys, remains of bridges and cemeteries abandoned by French and American firms at the beginning of the last century show the role that Panama has had in human transit. 
Tomás Mendizábal, the man responsible for classifying the items found during the various stages of the expansion process, said, "I find it odd, incredible, to dig in a little village lost in the middle of the Panama jungle and find European products along with handicrafts from Mexico." 
Since 2014, some media outlets have covered the amazing archaeological treasures that were emerging from the mountains of removed soil in the working area: 
During the digging, mountain blasting and clearing of thick vegetation, about 3,000 invertebrate and 500 vertebrate fossils were found, and also over 250 plants from a forest consumed by fire of a volcanic explosion, pointed out Hortensia Broce . fragments of objects from pre-Columbian, colonial, departmental and republican times also emerged. Bits of ceramic pots, arrowheads, and parts of a pre-Columbian grave, a 16-century dagger, a chimney from 1908, a collection of bottles, wagons and buckets for mixing concrete dating from the time when the Canal was built, were found both in the Pacific and Atlantic areas. 
In 2009, fossil teeth of Central American primates appeared as well. Jonathan Bloch, leader of the University of Florida team that investigated this finding, commented: 
these are the teeth of a South American monkey that, somehow, managed to achieve what no other animal was able to do back then: cross the Central American water route to tropical North America, some 21 million of years ago. 
Also on Twitter were photos and videos of the findings that have emerged during the expansion works:

Game of Thrones, the successful HBO TV series based on the written saga by George R.R. Martin, is at the end of its sixth season now, but hasn't ceased to inspire its fans. 
With loyal viewers throughout North America and Latin America, the show tells the story of noble families in a medieval fantasy world who do everything possible to be in power and eliminate their enemies. Despite the imaginary setting, it isn't difficult to see parallels between our world and the Game of Thrones world, with its political intrigue and characters both lovable and twisted. 
Argentinian 3D animator Damian Bosio was one of those fans who found his imagination sparked by the series, specifically by its animated title sequence, in which the lands of the fictional Game of Thrones world rise up from the ground with clockwork-like machinery. Damian then recreated the sequence for Argentina, then Latin America, and now will be expanding to other areas of our contemporary world. 
In a brief conversation, he told Global Voices: 
I saw the intro and the first thing I thought of was making an adapted version for my country (Argentina). I started with the city of Buenos Aires (the city where I live) with the idea of expanding it. 
The second was of Buenos Aires the capital and its metropolitan area. 
...and then all of Argentina. 
I was going finish my series, but I decided to expand it more. I made a fourth version with the whole of South America. 
Then I made one of North America. 
Seeing the title sequence reimagined for the 21st-century shows us that the more times change, the more they really stay the same. 
There is quite a bit of world left for me to animate, but I estimate that I will finish in Dubai. 
(I love Dubai) We'll have to wait to see if Damian makes his way to Asia, Africa, and Oceania. After all, some of these real-world locations and their histories loosely correspond to the fictional peoples and places in the series, like the Caucasus and the Dorthraki or the north of Iraq and the Second Sons.

Each year in early summer in Japan, if you're lucky you'll catch a glimpse of fireflies in late May and early June. 
Fireflies (Japan is home to the Asian firefly, Luciola parvula) require clean, running water, and have long been a associated with rice paddies, which are flooded in Japan each May. 
As part of a photography contest held by Tokyo Camera Club in June 2016, a number of photographers submitted amazing and surreal photographs of fireflies from around Japan.

According to columnist CP Aryal, a magazine called Bus Sahitya, meaning "bus literature," was launched several years ago in a move to acknowledge the literary value of the verses splashed on the back of vehicles. 
And Subid Guragain, a journalist and teacher, published a compilation of 700 such messages titled Truck Sahitya, meaning "truck literature," in 2011. Aryal writes: 
And why do so many do it? Govinda Lamsal, who drives a truck, says that in a line of work that is so mechanical, these words or images are a way of showing some creative flair and personal philosophy. “People perceive us as hardened folk without emotions,” he says. 
“Well, we have feelings too, and this is usually our only means of showing them while on the road.” 
Social media is full of examples of these verses. 
This truck carries a message mentioning Facebook and Twitter: 
If you can’t have Facebook, go for Twitter; 
If you can’t win a girl, make her sister. 
In America, young lead the country; 
Old get the pension. 
In Nepal, old rule the country; 
Young get the tension. 
Some messages have philosophical overtones: 
This truck is conveying the message: Don’t lose your cool in sorrow; don’t cross your limit in happiness. Image by Prabin Gurung. Used with permission. 
This one is similar: 
Spend money for honour, 
Don’t spend honour for money. 
Other messages talk about a driver’s life and the difficulties they face: 
A driver’s life, steering and brake. 
Some messages are satirical, like this one aimed at those who cannot stop talking about Nepal being the birthplace of Buddha: 
And here's a message for anyone who is impatient: 
Please don’t blow the horn, 
My country is sleeping. 
If you are contemplating a long drive on a Nepalese highway, these short messages are sure to break the monotony of your journey and bring a smile to your lips. A previous version of this story incorrectly implied that Pakistani trucks do not carry messages painted on them as well. 
Ugandan President's Leisurely Roadside Phone Call Inspires the #M7Challenge on Twitter &middot; Global Voices 
A photo posted on Facebook by Presidential Press Secretary Don Wanyama showing Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni speaking on the phone by the roadside. 
Twitter has exploded with funny memes after a photo appeared online showing Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni sitting on a chair by the roadside to make a call. His motorcade, which was on the way to a public event, stopped for about 30 minutes for him to make the call. 
Presidential Press Secretary Don Wanyama posted the photo on his Facebook page with the following message: 
On the way from Isingiro District yesterday where he'd presided over the World Population Day celebrations, President Museveni stopped at Kyeirumba Village to make a phone call. Curious residents gathered to look at the President, who after 30 minutes on phone, briefly interacted with them. They thanked the government for tarmacking the road linking Uganda to Tanzania through Isingiro. 
Some people wondered whether the photo was part of a plan to divert attention from the news of the release of main opposition politician Kizza Besigye, who was in jail for two months facing treason charges. But the #M7Challenge was too strategic to overshadow the release of Besigye dominating the internet &#x1f60a;&#x1f60a; — Daron (@bartlettdaron) July 13, 2016 
It is not yet known who Museveni was speaking to or the subject of the conversation. 
One Twitter user suggested that Museveni was speaking to leaders in South Sudan, where troubling violence has erupted: #M7Challenge : It is possible M7 was having a "Let my people go" discussion with the leaders of #SouthSudan. — Frank Hook (@FrancisHookDF) July 13, 2016 Museveni has ordered the Ugandan army to evacuate Ugandans living in South Sudan following recent clashes in the capital, Juba. Rosebell Kagumire warned #M7Challenge participants not to try this stunt: 
Don't try this at home. 
Fredrick Tumusiime shared an alleged advert for a local television station in Uganda:

Other Twitter users carried their office chairs outside to make a call: Hehehh &#x1f602;&#x1f602;. Sevo going places. 
The challenge, observed AutoblogKE, is a good tip for drivers: 
Omara Ronnie took his #M7Challenge photo at a footpath to show respect to all road users:

Recently Discovered Rock Paintings May Change Machu Picchu's History as We Know It &middot; Global Voices 
Machu Picchu. Image on Flickr by user Dan Doan (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0). 
Considered a masterpiece of architecture and engineering, Machu Picchu, declared one of the New 7 Wonders of the World in 2007, never ceases to amaze. 
On July 4, Pedro Astete, director of national archaeological park of Machu Picchu, reported the finding of two new rock paintings, close to the ruins of the most famous Inca city in the world: 
The image of a llama, a man and above both of them a geometric figure, were found in the area of Pachamama, on the access path to the archaeological area of Machu Picchu. 
In 1912, the second Peruvian expedition of Yale University, under the direction of Hiram Bingham, discovered four tombs. 
Until today, however, had gone . There are plans to carry out more digs in the area, which for the time being is not accessible to the general public. The images discovered have to be further examined to know for sure, but Peru's Tourism Portal reports that they might be from an era before the Incas: 
José Bastante, who is responsible for the sanctuary investigation program, said this finding might change the known history of the archaeological complex, as the figures might give clues about populations who lived before the Inca era. Bastante also claimed that this "may prove that the place had a special meaning for peoples before the Incas. 
These paintings have been well known for a long time and they can be easily seen as they are located near the road of Intipunku. We have photographs taken almost 20 years ago and there are several tourist guides who are aware of their existence. 
We even mention these paintings on a geological report about the landslides in Machupicchu in the early 2000s. Predictably, the news was echoed on Twitter, such as in a tweet by the US-based Spanish-language newspaper Diario Las Américas, which shared a photograph of the paintings: 
New rock paintings found in Machu Picchu. 
The video below is from 1936 and had remain unseen until now. It's a tour around different sites of Machu Picchu with typical Andean musical in the background. 
'Talking Dictionary' Transmits Language of Japan's Indigenous Ainu People &middot; Global Voices Ainu singers at the Ainu Museum in Hokkaido, Japan. 
Screencap from Andrew Jones Productions YouTube channel. An online "talking dictionary" first launched in 2009 is attempting to preserve and pass on the Ainu language spoken by the indigenous inhabitants of Japan's northeastern island of Hokkaido and Russian island territories to the north. 
According to UNESCO, there are eight languages in Japan that are critically endangered, and the Ainu language tops the list with the highest degree of endangerment. 
The project involves collaboration between Ainu speakers, the Endangered Languages Documentation Programme (ELDP) of School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), the Arcadia Trust, and Anna Bugaeva, a linguistics researcher at the Waseda Institute for Advanced Study (WIAS) in Japan. The purpose of the online project, completed in 2009, is not only to help preserve and transmit the Ainu language, but also to provide a safe long-term repository of language materials, to enable people to see what documentation has been created for a language, to encourage international co-operation between researchers, and to provide advice and collaboration for similar projects with other endangered languages around the world. The Ainu Talking Dictionary preserves and presents conversational Ainu in an online, searchable format. 
There is also an interface for linguists, and detailed notes about how to use the online resource. 
Screenshot of online 'Ainu Talking Dictionary' language learning tool. There is an urgent need to preserve the Ainu language. 
Although numbers are difficult to determine — questions about ethnicity are not included in the Japanese Census — it's estimated that just 25,000 Ainu remain in Japan, with fewer than 10 native speakers of the Ainu language. 
The Ainu people are the indigenous inhabitants of Hokkaido in northeastern Japan, as well as a string of islands to the north of Japan in Russia's Far East. 
When Japan decided to colonize Hokkaido and Sakhalin in the 1850's the Ainu were assimilated, placed on reservations, and succumbed to newly introduced diseases. Today, Ainu culture in Japan mainly lives on at tourist attractions and in folk museums in Hokkaido and Tokyo. 
Jinbo, a surveyor, had learned Ainu to communicate with indigenous people living Hokkaido. Kanazawa, a linguist, documented words and phrases to create the dictionary that would help transmit the Ainu language into the 21st Century. According to Bugaeva: 
We deleted all questionable words and examples, items that were extremely different from Setsu Kurokawa’s audio, and words that Setsu Kurokawa was unfamiliar with. 
Double entries were basically consolidated to one entry. However, since the video data and audio data were recorded separately, there are cases where the Ainu expression is different in the video and audio. In those cases only, we decided that these were separate expressions, and listed both. 
For particularly rare words, we checked whether they were used in existing dictionaries, and added notes to them. In addition to the original notations, various information that can aid learning the Ainu language including the colloquial translation, Modernized Roman character transcriptions and katakana transcriptions of the Ainu word, interpretation (glossary) and English translation, etc., are provided. 
With the help of Setsu Kurokawa, a native speaker of the Saru Dialect of Ainu (Nukibetsu), we were able to upload audio of the Ainu language onto the web. We received many responses and comments from students and researchers regarding these contents. 
Kurokawa, an Ainu elder born in 1926 in Nukibetsu, in southwestern Hokkaido, grew up hearing the language: When Setsu Kurokawa (born, January 5, 1926) was a child, in the late 1920's, many Ainu families had already stopped speaking Ainu at home. Considering this, Setsu Kurokawa's proficiency in Ainu is relatively high. This can be explained by the fact that she was often taken care of by her grandfather and grandmother. 
However, since Ainu is not used currently in everyday life, it was difficult to record the spontaneous utterances of the language. In this audio material, the words and expressions are not the spontaneous utterances of Setsu Kurokawa, but instead are audio data initiated based on the Ainugo kaiwa jiten . 
The Ainu language expressions in this audio material are based on the Ainugo kaiwa jiten, and do not completely match Setsu Kurokawa's idiolect. Bugaeva's finished dictionary was presented to a group of Ainu community members in Tokyo at the Ainu Cultural Center (which itself has online resources dedicated to transmitting the Ainu language) in February 2009. 
The online tool created in collaboration with Japanese co-editor Shiho Endo and programmer David Nathan (ELAR director, SOAS, University of London) and with an art input of the Ainu community, with web-design by Tamami Kaizawa. 
Indian YouTube Channel Conquers the Hearts And Minds of Millions Across the World &middot; Global Voices 
Have you ever noticed what your toddler is watching online, when you hand them a screen in order to enjoy a little respite from the demands of parenting? If your child is like most, their eyes are likely glued to recycled popular rhymes pouring from the mouths of cartoon characters singing catchy tunes. 
Have you ever wondered why your kids happily spend so much of their childhoods watching these videos? 
My daughter is probably responsible for a major chunk of number of views. 
Chu chu TV rhyme zone! #GokhaiGayu https://t.co/oJpBdJI20I — Kuhn-Al (@meaninist) July 13, 2016 
Tell me about it!! 
No wonder. 
I see every toddler watching #ChuChuTv on the phone. Great idea. https://t.co/XljNR2IGfK — Sakshi Joshi (@sakshijoshi85) July 13, 2016 The smile I get from my daughter when I put on Chu Chu TV for her, am tired of the show but am happy she likes it because she really learn alot from it.&#x1f603;&#x1f603;&#x1f603;&#x1f603;she's even repeating some words from it,so thumbs up to that!!! ‪#‎carissaquietmode‬ ‪#‎herloveforlearning‬ ‪#‎herfavouriteshow‬ ‪#‎myhappychild‬ ‪#‎cantbtiredwhenshelearning‬ 
British blogger Karen at Missing Sleep writes how Chu Chu TV helped her son grow: 
I do feel we would have benefited from ChuChu TV though with youngest especially as he was more of a reluctant learner unless something seemed very fun and captivating for him. 
He tends to switch off otherwise, so I really want to introduce as many parents to ChuChu TV as possible who might have challenging pre-schoolers like I did and are in need of a little learning inspiration to pass the time. 
The channel also encourages good behaviour, such as the importance of sharing and telling the truth. 
A blogger at Champa Tree, for instance, writes how her son was inspired by a video on Chu Chu TV: One day I watched him listening to a very interesting rhyme on the channel. 
However, the repetitive rhymes can be annoying for other people at home. Why yes son I want to watch the same thing again for the millionth time...#momneedsabreak #chuchutv #saveme — MamaShelby (@scossey1990) June 6, 2016 
@sanchayan @hankypanty I can hear CHU CHU TV SURPRISE!! even in my nightmares. — Rituparna Chatterjee (@MasalaBai) July 13, 2016 
In an interview with TubeFilter, Vinod Chandar mentioned that Chu Chu is the nickname of his daughter, Harshita. 
He said the channel's success lies in its focus on “quality”: 
We concentrate on quality rather than quantity. 
We work hard on each and every aspect while creating a video which includes concept creation, lyrics, music, graphics, animation and then the final edit. We just don’t compromise and the results are showing. How much screen time children should have on a daily basis is hotly debated. 
The average American child, for example, watches more than four hours of TV a day—twice the limit recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Watching television at excessive rates deprives children of much-needed physical exercise. However, if you allow restricted screen time with quality content, experts have found that kids can develop some good skills. 
Moreover, as any parent guiltily knows, screen time (watching television, and using tablets and mobile phones) is probably the cheapest and most reliable form of babysitting available to most moms and dads. 'Playing for Change' Promotes Peace and Inclusion Around the World Through Music &middot; Global Voices 
Playing For Change's objective is to unite people through music. 
It is a cultural project that connects musicians all around the world by using emblematic songs. According to its creator, filmmaker and producer Mark Johnson, the idea occurred to him in New York: About 10 years ago I had an experience in NYC that opened my eyes to the power of music. 
I was on my way to work at a recording studio in NYC and I was in the subway station when I witnessed two monks painted all in white wearing robes. 
Some people where smiling while others where crying but everyone was deeply connected to the music. I got on the train and headed to work and I thought to myself the greatest music I had ever heard was on the way to the studio and not in the studio. I realized great music and art are just moments in time and they exist everywhere. We can use the energy from these moments to connect people. 
His effort to bring people from different cultures, ethnicities, religions and political backgrounds together through music began to take shape in March 2005 with what is considered one of the best songs of the 20th century &#8212; 'Stand By Me' by Ben E. King. American singer Roger Ridley sang it in the streets of Santa Monica in California, and afterwards, Mark added other voices and sounds recorded in Barcelona, Ireland, South Africa, India, Nepal and the Middle East. At the time of writing, the video had more than 90 million views online. 
Two years later in 2007, he created the foundation of the same name: 
We couldn’t agree more. At the Playing For Change Foundation, we live our lives by this principle and apply it to everything we do. 
Colombia, Mexico and Argentina 
The organisation's inclusive message has reached a wide range of countries. In 2010, Mark went to Colombia to record Carlos Vives' song 'La tierra del olvido' (The Land of Forgetfulness) with backing from the Americas Business Council, which was created in 2008 to encourage cultural development in the Americas. According to Playing for Change: This video features over 75 musicians across the country of Colombia. 
Throughout our journey we have learned that music is the greatest tool for healing broken countries, cultures and hearts. 
With this video we set out to unite and inspire the people of Colombia so they can move forward from years of conflict and create a positive future. 
Their success led them to try again in other countries, and in 2012 they went to Mexico to record 'México lindo y querido' (Beautiful and Beloved Mexico). They aimed to support Cauce ciudadano (Citizen Channel), a civil society organisation that works with youth to combat the country's violence. 
The following year, Playing for Change arrived in Argentina to support an environmental campaign called 'Dejá tu huella: una Reserva con más Reservas' (Leave Your Mark: A Reserve with More Reserves). The chosen song was called 'Carnaval toda la vida' (Lifelong Carnival) by a ska band called Los Fabulosos Cadillacs. Erzo Bueno, who produced the video, said: 
It's an honour to get involved in the preservation of these native forests. 
We believe that music has the power to get people behind this worthy cause. Playing For Change is still creating connections in Latin America today. In 2015 they returned to Colombia to support the orphanage Betsalem in their project to create a music school, which they are then hoping to replicate in other parts of the country. 
On 24 September 2016, they will celebrate Playing for Change Day, which will unite musicians and music lovers alike through 46 events taking place in 21 countries in support of the different projects that the organisation is involved in. 
These African and Scandinavian Musicians Create Sweet Sounds in Copenhagen &middot; Global Voices 
Musicians from Scandinavia and southern Africa play a jam session at a Danish café during the Copenhagen Jazz Festival this month. 
This article by Sonia Narang originally appeared on PRI.org on July 12, 2016, and is republished here as part of a content-sharing agreement. 
During the annual Copenhagen Jazz Festival in July, people can hear music coming from street corners, open-air plazas, and iconic jazz clubs across Denmark’s capital. On one Sunday afternoon during the recent festival, I saw a little Danish café turn into a meeting place for global cultures. 
Inside Café Blå Time, which means “Blue Hour café” (or "Blue Time café") in Danish, a crowd gathered to watch a line-up of international musicians: a drummer/singer from Mozambique, Swedish brothers who play the saxophone and piano, a singer adopted from Swaziland who now lives in Denmark, a Finnish bass player, and a guitarist from Namibia. 
I’d seen him perform in front of a packed house at another venue in Copenhagen the previous night, and wanted to find out more about his music. 
Listen to this story on PRI.org &raquo; Siquir moved to Sweden when he was in his mid-20s. 
He moved to Scandinavia in his mid-20’s and plays with musicians from around the world at the annual Copenhagen Jazz Festival. 
In the 15 years he’s lived in Scandinavia — including seven in Copenhagen — he has built up a large network of friends and supporters. 
In his shows, he brings together what he calls “an all-star” band of musicians who gel on stage despite disparate backgrounds. 
“A Swedish guy, and a Mozambican guy, and a Danish guy, they’re speaking one language, which is the music language,” Siquir says. 
“That’s what we want to reflect to the society, that it’s possible.” 
“When we play the music, people in the audience feel like this is like my kitchen at home with the family, and we talk in a sweet way together,” Bäck says. 
He enjoys playing with people of different musical styles, and says, “African music is so rhythmical and ecstatic, so it’s good for me when it takes some breaks and relaxes, and then you go with the energy again.” 
I find out she’s a singer who performed 16 gigs at last year’s jazz festival. 
“My dad is a Zulu and my mom is from Swaziland,” she says. She was adopted by Danish parents who lived in South Africa during apartheid, and now live in Denmark. 
“They’ve been quite a beautiful guidance for me, because they were the Caucasian people in the black world during apartheid and now it’s me, a little black girl in a white world,” Stensgaard says. 
Jazz Singer Maria Thandie performed 16 gigs during last year’s jazz festival in Copenhagen. This summer, she says she’s mostly just attending events to support fellow musicians, and pops into a few jam sessions like this one to sing. 
Stensgaard grew up with gospel and blues, and says she mixed her African inspirations into that music. “I’m really a storyteller,” she says, adding, “I’m a live person. I never wanted to record. 
That’s my thing. I need the crowd. 
Today, she takes the stage to sing the jazz classic, “Summertime,” a lovely melody that captures the entire café’s attention. “We do what we do best on stage, and it’s like we’re having this conversation with our instruments and getting to know each other by what we love the most,” Stensgaard says. “And, for me, that’s magic, yeah. 
I love it.” A little later, singer and guitarist Jackson Wahengo adds some more lively flavor to the jam session with his rhythmic blend of African folk and pop. 
He grew up in the refugee camps of Angola singing freedom songs for his country Namibia, which became an independent nation in 1990. 
Remembering Mahasweta Devi, Indian Writer and Tribal Rights Activist &middot; Global Voices 
Renowned Indian Bengali writer and social activist Mahasweta Devi passed away aged 90-years-old on Thursday, July 28, 2016 in Kolkata. 
She was the wife of one of Bengal’s most prolific playwrights and literary figures, Bijon Bhattacharya. 
Born in the tumultuous years of the British reign in India, Mahasweta Devi grew up in a family of artists, poets and social activists leading Bengal's literary movement (Kallol) at the time. 
Surrounded and influenced by communist ideas all her life, she began her working life as a journalist in post-independence India and later went on to become an advocate for civil rights of indigenous tribes. 
Writer Mahasweta Devi passes away in Kolkata. What a life !!!! — Mahesh Bhatt (@MaheshNBhatt) July 28, 2016 
She was one of the founders of Denotified and Notified Tribal Rights Action Group, whose work among tribal communities spread from Bengal, Gujarat to Maharastra. 
Ganesh N. Devy, in a seminar in 2004 on 'Celebrating Women: a symposium on women who made a difference', spoke of his shared experiences with Mahasweta Devi: 
I had by now observed that she spared no one, in particular snobs, ministers, insincere journalists and literary aspirants. She spoke of the civilizational graces of the adivasis, of how our society had mindlessly destroyed the culture of our great continent, and how the innocents had been brutalised. She described the context in which the infamous Criminal Tribes Act, 1871 was introduced, the process of denotification in 1952 and the plight of the nomadic communities in India ever since. 
Dopdi, short story 
Draupadi, an important female character in the Hindu epic, Mahabharata, was the subject of a bet in a game by her husband Yudhisthir, who eventually lost her in a round of the game after losing everything else. 
She was then forcibly dragged into court by his rivals who intend to strip her naked. 
However, when Draupadi silently pleads to Krishna (a major Hindu deity), he aids her with an endless supply of sari cloth which the enemy is unable to strip away from her, and this act ultimately saves Draupadi from her public humiliation. Mahasweta Devi's Draupadi - still chillingly relevant, when you remember the adivasi women raped and killed by... https://t.co/P21v1uwLXL — Kavita Krishnan (@kavita_krishnan) July 31, 2016 
Re-imagining this story, Mahasweta Devi changed the leading character of Draupadi to Dopdi Mejhen, a tribal woman. 
In her story the men succeeded in stripping the heroine naked. Devi's audacity in depicting the plight of a tribal woman not only highlighted the different treatment of women across the social caste system but also the treatment women receive in the world as a whole. 
Although Dopdi is stripped naked, she still stands as a symbol of strength. 
Draupadi who tears up the rags they throw at her and flings them away, flaunting her nakedness in Senanayak’s face: Draupadi comes closer. 
Stands with her hand on her hip, laughs and says, The object of your search, Dopdi Mejhen. 
You asked them to make me up, don’t you want to see how they made me? 
Thus, according to Gayatri C. Spivak's English translation of the story, Dopdi escapes humiliation by refusing to put her clothes back on after being stripped of them, turning the shame back on Senanayak. 
Mahasweta Devi's career spanned more than two decades and produced a timeless collection of literature driven by compassion for her compatriots. 
Her status as an inspiration for coming generations of Indian writers is indisputable. 
Condolences pour in for the late writer 
Journalists and writers took to twitter to share their grievances, along with a number of prominent literary organisations. "Draupadi", "Hazaar churasir ma"-must read from the mighty #MahaswetaDevi . 
Writers will come and writers will go but there will never be another Mahasweta Devi . 
Great writer, great activist , great human being . — Javed Akhtar (@Javedakhtarjadu) July 28, 2016 RIP Mahasweta Devi. A terrible loss for literature. 
A great writer and extraordinary activist; a woman with a warm, generous heart. — Amitav Ghosh (@GhoshAmitav) July 28, 2016 
A Recipe for the Perfect Kyrgyz Advert: Horses, Mountain Scenery and a Beautiful Woman &middot; Global Voices 
Screenshot from full-length advert uploaded on Shoro's Youtube channel. 
The Maksym Shoro beverage produced by ex-Soviet Kyrgyzstan's leading soft drinks producer Shoro is not everybody's cup of tea, but those that love the salty fermented drink truly love it. 
After more than two decades of success in the local market &#8212; the drink is almost as old as the Central Asian country itself &#8212; it can now be bought in neighbouring Kazakhstan and Russia, where over a million Kyrgyz migrants live and work. 
But Shoro has retained the nomadic identity associated with its homeland, as the company's latest advert shows. Below is the advert in full as well as a translation of the message the company posted on Facebook to mark its arrival: 
One day early in the morning a brave Kyrgyz guy rode out on his trusty steed to the neighbouring meadow. He heard that a beautiful woman who had won the hearts of many champions had lived there. In Kyrgyzstan, there is an ancient game - Kyz Kuumai. 
If not, the girl will strike him with a whip, and the rider will lose face before the people. But, if the guy pleases the girl, she can quietly give in to him . 
After all, as our ancestors always said, do not ask for a quick horse, ask for a safe journey. Maksym Shoro &#8212; the drink of nomads. 
Pampulha Ensemble, Precursor to Brasilia, Gets UNESCO World Heritage Status &middot; Global Voices 
Pampulha Church. Image: Flickr / Ludmila Tavares 
On July 17, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) awarded World Heritage status to Brazil's Pampulha Modern Ensemble, in Minas Gerais' state capital, Belo Horizonte. 
The Ensemble includes four buildings: the Casino (now known as the Pampulha Museum of Art), the Ballroom, the São Francisco de Assis Church, and the Tennis Yacht Club, all designed in the early 1940s by Brazil's late-great modernist architect Oscar Niemeyer. 
The UNESCO candidacy for Pampulha started in 1996 as one item on a list of many of Brazil's worthy heritage locations. 
However, it was only in 2012 that the Belo Horizonte government doubled down on its efforts, which finally bore fruit four years later—and for good reason. 
UNESCO's webpage for what is now Brazil's 20th World Heritage site hints at the factors behind its decision to bestow such an award: The Ensemble comprises bold forms that exploit the plastic potential of concrete, while fusing architecture, landscape design, sculpture and painting into a harmonious whole. 
And while the building's design spoke loudly, the church bell remained silent until 1959. According to the author Marcelo Cedro in a paper on Kubicheck and the Pampulha church, the absence of a cross caused Dom Cabral, the Archbishop of Belo Horizonte, to say "without the sign of the cross, the curves seem to want to pierce the soil in search of darkness.” 
Cedro went on to say that the long-lasting non-consecration of the church may have been retribution for its "sins"—not only its sensual design, but the ostentation of the Ensemble, which included a casino. While it was considered heresy by the Catholic Church, the city government called it a monument and bestowed upon it historical and artistic heritage status. 
Flickr - Image: Rodrigo Denúbila The “Casa do Baile” (Ballroom) was originally created in 1943 on an artificial island as an event space, with a restaurant and a ballroom. 
Affected by the nearby casino closure that had given the Ensemble an air of excitement, the Ballroom shut down in 1948 and was repurposed several times until it became the Reference Center for Architecture, Urbanism, and Design in 2002.

Modeled after a boat ready for entry into the water, the Tennis Yacht Club (originally known as the Golf Yacht Club) was built in 1942, and noticeably lacks the curvaceous features of the other buildings. 
The raison d'être behind its construction was to serve as a place of family fun and recreation, in addition to being the location for themed parties. 
Tennis Yacht Club. Official Site Pampulha, the Start of Brasília 
Oscar Niemeyer, who passed away in 2012 at the age of 104, was best known for co-designing Brazil's capital, Brasília, in the mid-1950s. 
While the Pampulha Ensemble might become known throughout the world now that UNESCO has placed it in the spotlight, a lesser-known fact is that "Pampulha was the start of Brasília," according to Niemeyer himself. 
To understand better what was meant by such a phrase, one must go back at least to the 1940s, if not to the late 1800s. In 1897, Brazil as a republic was just nine years old, and the previous capital of Minas Gerais state, Ouro Preto, was not only highly associated with mining and the monarchy but it also held little hope for viable growth. 
The idea was to find a way to cope with population growth, for which, ironically, the planned city had not planned. For the task, he called upon a rising name in the world of architecture, the 33-year-old Oscar Niemeyer, to create the Pampulha Modern Ensemble. This was the young architect's first solo project, and it would become the catapult for, as well as precursor to, the creation of Brasília. 
(The idea itself traces as far back as 1763.) Thanks to the success of Pampulha, President Kubitschek (aka the Father of Modern Brazil) knew he could trust Niemeyer, if not merely for his view on integrating nature into his art, for which Niemeyer said the following: It's not the right angle that attracts me, nor the straight line, hard, inflexible, created by man. 
What attracts me is the free and sensual curve, the curve I find in the mountains of my country, in the sinuous course of its rivers, in the waves of the sea, the body of a beloved woman. 
In a practically unused part of his growing city, Juscelino Kubitschek, along with Oscar Niemeyer, never just saw what was actually there, but rather what could be—a feat both men would repeat more than a decade later in the country's new capital. 
Sadly, Kubitschek would die in a car accident in 1976 and wouldn't see his Belo Horizonte-born vision become a World Heritage site. The Pampulha Ensemble and Brasília—two of his biggest projects—would live on, however, much like the timeless architecture of his chief architect. 
To hear the story of the Pampulha Ensemble straight from Niemeyer, be sure to check out this 23-minute short film (in Portuguese), titled “Pampulha—O Marco,” directed by Moacir de Oliveira. Despite Not Winning a Single Olympic Medal, Nepalese Have Reasons to Be Proud &middot; Global Voices

Their country's athletes haven't won a medal at the Olympics in Rio (yet), but Nepalese are smiling nonetheless, thanks to media praise for their national anthem and one swimmer's age-defying performance. 
The youngest athlete at the Rio Olympics, Gaurika Singh, is Nepalese. She was 13 years and 255 days old when she competed in the 100-meter backstroke heats. 
Though she didn't make it into the final round and wasn't able to break the national record &#8212; which she set herself &#8212; she beat the other two swimmers in the heat she was competing in. 
That's a good record: Nepal's #GaurikaSingh 'became the youngest person ever to win a heat in the Olympic pool' https://t.co/JtfIIX3X17 — Ujjwal Acharya (@UjjwalAcharya) August 8, 2016

The Dead Are Returning Home and It’s Time to Party in Japan &middot; Global Voices 
Minato Mirai Bon Dance (みなとみらい大盆踊り) by Flickr user muratama. License: CC BY-SA 2.0. 
Every year in mid-August, Japan observes Obon (お盆), the Festival of the Dead, when the dead return to the ancestral home for several days to spend time with the living. Obon typically occurs on August 15 throughout most of Japan. 
Bon dances (盆踊り, Bon Odori) are also held all over Japan, as well. These dances are typically held in neighborhood gathering places, such as Shinto shrines, Buddhist temples, public plazas, and even the parking lots of supermarkets. 
Many people celebrating upload photographs and videos of their local Bon dances to Instagram. 
Everyone in the neighborhood comes out for the Bon dance, especially families with young children. We went with friends from the neighborhood to the Bon dance, and there were lots of kids there from preschool. They all danced liked crazy. 
Walking home I had a chance to chat with other mothers. # kidstagram #sisters# #insta_toddler #thechildrenoftheworld #pixel_kids #kidsfashionforall #cutekidsclub #4yearsold #1yearsold #kids_japan #tv_kidz #kids_of_our_world #beautiful_kids_of_the_world #littleandbrave #minibymini #ministyleblog #instamamme #mamxmam 
Some Bon dances in Japan are very elaborate, attracting thousands of spectators. The Awa Odori festival in Tokushima Prefecture is probably the most famous of Japan's Bon dances, attracting at least a million people each year to the city.

In Nike's Ad About Female Athletes in India, Too Much Glamour, Not Enough Names? &middot; Global Voices 
A recent advertisement by leading American sportswear company Nike featuring badminton player-turned-Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone and other sportswomen has faced criticism from some netizens in India for not identifying anyone but Padukone by name and for glamorising what strong Indian women look like. 
The video, titled "Da Da Ding", shows several Indian sportswomen playing their respective sports and purports to promote women's athletics. The lyrics of the song accompanying the video also suggest the same. Padukone herself explained the idea on her Facebook page, where she shared the ad: 
And so I want to say to every girl and every boy and every woman and every man...play a sport...because it changed my life...and it will change yours too! Sport has taught me how to survive! 
It has made me unstoppable! The video shared by Padukone has received 3.6 million views and thousands of likes and shares. 
However, some weren't happy that the ad only spotlighted Padukone and didn't name any of the other sportswomen featured. Critics argued that this perpetuates the invisiblisation of women athletes in India: 
That Nike Ad shows how little we know about female sportsperson or athletes in this country. — SreeV (@SreekrishnanV) July 12, 2016 
I am sure people who watched #DaDaDing video by Nike can't even name 5 female athletes who hv been featured in the ad. 
"Kya fayda?" translates as "What’s the point?" 
I wish Nike had made the ad about sports women without Deepika. Would have been more real. 
But then who would watch it! — Binty Mehta (@bintymehta) July 11, 2016 
Jaideep Vaidya at independent news site Scroll.in was of the view that it was a shame Nike took such an approach: Nike itself does not name or feature any of the women from the ad on its website apart from Padukone, and leaves it to the media to publish the names from its press release or by themselves. 
A pity, then, that despite breaking new ground in a country where brand-building hasn't really focused on women athletes, the ad drew attention to itself rather than the people it featured. 
One Nike spokesperson reportedly admitted the fact that most viewers would probably not recognize the athletes in the ad. Others came to the company's defense: 
If you don't know a single athlete in the Nike Ad, then it reflects on you. 
Not on Nike, or the ad, or D Pad. &#x1f602;&#x1f602; — Vijayeta (@SacredInsanity) 12 de julio de 2016 
Gender inequality in Indian society is the oft-cited reason behind prejudice towards women's sport. The lack of awareness of India's successful female athletes can be attributed to this built-in structural discrimination. Tennis star Sania Mirza, who is currently ranked number 1 in women's doubles tennis worldwide, had emphasized this point in the recent past as well. 
'Da Da Ding: The Other Women' 
The video, which had received more than 85,000 views at the time of writing this article, conveys the fact that hardworking women from lower-income backgrounds in India have been "doing it, barefoot" &#8212; a clear dig at Nike's tagline "Just Do It" &#8212; without any glamorous representations or expensive footwear. Staff at Scroll.in commented: 
the other Indian women are profiled – the thousands who are part of the labour force, engaged in activities like farming or construction (their share in both is around 50 per cent) or just household activities that require carrying water over large distances day in and day out. 
Some Twitter users enthusiastically responded to this parody video: 
Been doing it!!!

Nike's Da Da Ding ad campaign modified for the women who have been silently "just doing it" for hundreds of years https://t.co/4XJsFIurUA — Sachin Kalbag (@SachinKalbag) July 27, 2016 
The complex intersection of class and gender in a country full of inequalities like India will perhaps continue to provoke such controversies in the future as well. 
Racism Almost Made Brazil’s First 2016 Olympic Gold Medalist Quit Judo &middot; Global Voices 
Photo: David Ramos/Getty Images, used with permission from Rio2016. Brazil is still in awe of Rafaela Silva's victory in judo, which brought in the 2016 Olympic host's first gold medal. 
But for those outside Brazil, many may have forgotten the racial abuse she suffered in 2012 after being disqualified from the London Olympics. 
Rafaela grew up in a poor family in a favela in Rio de Janeiro called Cidade de Deus, made famous by the 2002 film City of God. Along with her older sister Raquel Silva, she started to learn judo at the age of 8 at the Instituto Reação, a social project founded by former Brazilian judoka Flávio Canto, who won a Bronze medal in Athens 2004. 
She left the arena in tears. "I went to my room and got my phone looking for some sort of comfort, some message", she said in an interview to Globo Espetacular, a local TV channel, in January &#8212; only to open her Twitter to find other users slandering racial abuse and offenses at her. 
Brazilian website Sensacionalista gathered a couple of those tweets (many have now been deleted). 
"This @rafaelasilvaa is an embarrassment for Brazilian judo, she should be banished from sports". 
"Beware of making something stupid in 2016 in Brazil, that is, if you get a spot in the Olympics at all hahaha" 
"Olympics are serious. Not a police gunfight". "Uh, I'm scared! 
She should calm herself down, otherwise will take another ippon this time with my whip" 
Rafaela also showed her Twitter feed to reporters at that time where one tweet read "a monkey's place is at the cage, not the Olympics". 
Her long time coach Geraldo Bernardes said that for a while she barely wanted to leave the house, fearing she would be recognized in the streets in Rio de Janeiro and would be verbally attacked. Only with a few months of psychological treatment she decided to get back on her feet in 2013, when she decided to compete in the judo world championship &#8212; which she won in her category.

A New Digital Tool Helped Rio de Janeiro Activists Document Abuses in the Olympics &middot; Global Voices 
Screenshot of the WITNESS website. 
The Rio Olympics recently welcomed the world’s finest athletes and provided a stage for Herculean feats of physical achievement, but the event’s host city stood as a backdrop of stark inequality. From the forced eviction of the community of Vila Autódromo to give way to the Olympic Park to deplorable working conditions, myriad rights violations underlay the spectacle. 
It might have been easy for these abuses to be swept under the rug as the media’s light shone on medals and pageantry, but activists harnessed the power of new technology to compile and share evidence of the cost of Rio 2016. 
CrowdVoice.by is a new tool that enables activists and grassroots organizations to collaboratively curate media related to their causes. It streamlines the task of collecting and disseminating evidence, drawing in content from multiple sources for distribution across many different platforms. It encourages users to harness the power of their networks to work faster and smarter. 
WITNESS, an international organization that trains citizens in the documentation of rights violations, used CrowdVoice.by to curate live streams and information shared on social media regarding the the conditions faced by residents of Rio de Janeiro for its feature "Rio 2016 Human Rights Live." Because CrowdVoice.by employs embeds, it can be easily used in conjunction with other tools within the framework of an organization’s webpage. 
Screenshot of the Rio2036 website. Though CrowdVoice.by is only in its beta iteration, it is already seeing adoption by the technology-savvy activists of Rio de Janeiro to ensure that the issues they work to address are not eclipsed or overlooked. 
CrowdVoice.by and tools like it have countless applications in countless communities beyond Brazil and beyond the Olympics. 
Technologies tailored specifically for the needs of human rights defenders have the ability to empower citizens everywhere to tell their own stories, and use the evidence they gather to demand culpability and change.

A Japanese artist is using traditional artisanal craft techniques to create compelling bamboo insects that have developed a devoted following online. 
Uses chikusei (bamboo crafting), Noriyuki Saitoh uploads photos of his insects to social media and to his website. He also tweets images of his intricately detailed bamboo insects, which are typically shared and reposted hundreds of times. 
For a good selection of Saitoh's bamboo insect creations, see his most recent Twitter New Year's card, addressed to his followers, with photos of bamboo paper wasps, a mantis, a beetle, damselflies and a cicada: Thanks for all of your follows, RTs, and likes over the past year. 
You all inspire me to do everything I do. 
Detailed photo essays of Saitoh's creations can also be found on his Facebook page. 
Saitoh is careful to point out that his creations are intended to be art, rather than accurate models of insects: 
My insect creations are not intended to be realistic. 
Since I'm not using specimens or replicas. I'm not aiming for accuracy in proportion, but instead I'm focused on the detail, impression of, and feel of the bamboo insect.

Brazil’s Highest Mountain Is Reopening for Ecotourism Guided by the Yanomami People &middot; Global Voices An unprecedented expedition to Brazil's highest mountain aims to prepare a trail for ecotourism. 
Photo: Guilherme Gnipper/Funai, published with permission 
This story by Marcos Wesley was originally published on Medium by Instituto Socioambiental, and is republished here as part of a partnership with Global Voices. 
If climbing Pico da Neblina (Mist Peak) is already an exciting experience, imagine the journey guided by a Yanomami shaman who spent his or her entire youth right beside the mountain? 
"This place was our house and we called it Irokae (the cry of the guariba monkey)", says shaman Carlos Yanomami in his own language, pointing to the forest, where his relatives lived in a home, having parties and practicing rituals, 60 years ago. 
Climbers all over the world know about Pico da Neblina. With a summit 2,995 meters (almost 10,000 feet) above sea level, it's Brazil's highest mountain. Nestled in the middle of the Amazon forest, it's been closed off for visitation since 2003 on a recommendation by the federal prosecutor's office and a decision by IBAMA, Brazil's environmental agency. 
Some climbers were frustrated to lose access to the mountain, but policymakers argue that something needed to be done to halt the region's environmental degradation and to protect the rights of the Yanomami. 
A mountain in the proximity of Pico da Neblina. Photo: Guilherme Gnipper/Funai, published with permission. 
This July marked the completion of the reopening's first stage: an expedition of 32 people walked for ten days all the way to the summit of Yaripo, as the Yanomami call the mountain, to investigate and map the conditions of the trail. Besides Carlos, another 18 Yanomami were part of the team, 16 of them men and two women, Maria and Floriza. 
They are training to monitor the trail and to work as guides, porters, and cookers, and to manage the ecotourism project that they plan to develop. Representatives of ICMbio (Brazil's conservation agency), the public prosecutors office, and the Brazilian army also took part in the expedition. Packing GPS trackers, cameras, and a lot of interest, the explorers listened to shaman Carlos' stories while walking the 36-kilometer (22-mile) trail, which begins at the village of Igarapé Tucano, at the Yanomami indigenous reserve, near the town of São Gabriel da Cachoeira in the Brazilian state of Amazonas. 
While overcoming large distances and difficult terrains, the indigenous group marked the places where they spotted animals or their tracks, places with drinking water, parts of the trail that need improvement, and the most adequate places for the construction of overnight camping grounds. 
The team also identified the most environmentally sensitive areas. Maria Yanomami, 52, made history by becoming the first Yanomami woman ever to reach the summit of Yaripo. Her trail companion, Floriza Yanomami, however, couldn't finish the walk out of respect for and fear of her own traditions: the day before she would have reached the summit, she got her period, and so she turned back, rather than break custom and risk upsetting the spirits who live at the summit. 
If she had completed her journey while menstruating, according to tradition, she could have endangered the lives of everyone in her travel group. 
A young Yanomami who took part in the expedition to Pico da Neblina. Photo: Guilherme Gnipper/Funai, published with permission. 
The trail's development should also benefit the AYRCA community association, in which all Yanomami people take part. 
When Yaripo is finally opened to tourism, the stories of Carlos Yanomami and his people will gain new life, and visitors to Pico da Neblina will spread them across the world. 
The Yaripo Ecotourism project is looking for supporters. If you're interested in supporting this initiative or want more information about it, please send an email to marcos@socioambiental.org. 
Emojis Created for and by Indigenous Peoples in Latin America &middot; Global Voices 
Republished with permission. 
Across Latin America, indigenous language digital activists are taking the lead by creating culturally diverse emojis available for use in electronic communication as a way to promote their native culture and language. 
In the last couple years, tech companies such as Apple and Twitter have responded to calls for more emoji diversity, giving users the option of selecting different skin tones. Despite some negative applications of these new emojis, the additions have been applauded and have opened up requests for the inclusion of other cultures and regions, such as a petition to add a hijab option. 
Indigenous groups are among those who would like to see their cultures reflected in emojis. Instead of waiting for companies to finally include them, some internet users have taken it upon themselves to create their own emoji sets. 
Luis Padhum Flores, who is from the state of San Luís Potosí, México, is a digital activist promoting his native Huastec (also known as Tének) language. One of his current projects include creating a set of emojis depicting faces in typical headdresses and hats, which he shared on his Facebook account. 
Republished with permission. 
And Mapuche schoolteacher Victor Carilaf has teamed up with Chilean artist Fiestoforo to launch Kimeltuwe, which promotes the Mapudungun language spoken by the Mapuche people in Chile and Argentina. As part of the project, they've created illustrations depicting Mapuche culture with an emphasis on transmitting the local language. Some of their illustrations include emojis of faces and people in traditional dress, which they encourage their 112,000 Facebook fans to use in their communication. 
Republished with permission. 
With both projects, the creators are still searching for ways to fully integrate the emojis into different messaging platforms. For now, they have been using them as images or stickers that can be downloaded, edited and shared as jpegs or other image formats in comments or messaging. 
'When Your Palms Itch, You Will Receive Money', and Other African Myths &middot; Global Voices 
If a young woman eats out of a pot, she supposedly will not get married. Creative Commons image by Rach151. Africans, like people elsewhere in the world, use Twitter in many ways. 
Sometimes it's to have a laugh at themselves. 
Sometimes it's to find common ground across countries and cultures. Sometimes it's both. For example, @IGtiz, a Kenyan student, has started the #100AfricanMyths hashtag to share myths that are passed on from generation to generation in African countries, mostly orally. 
Myths in Africa serve different socio-cultural needs. 
Parents, for instance, use myths to keep their young ones in check. 
Here is a sample of some of the more hilarious African myths. 
Faith Mulungi, a Ugandan radio presenter, tweeted: 
When your palms itch,you will receive money#100AfricanMyths — Faith Liam Mulungi (@Omulungi_Hawt) September 27, 2016 
@PatohShanqueels explained a common myth that went around schools where caning took place:

Thais in a Crowded Community Are Playing in the 'World’s First' Non-Rectangular Football Field &middot; Global Voices 
A non-rectangular football field? Well, if there’s no available space, why not? The AP Thailand company developed a non-rectangular football field in Khlong Toei, a working-class district near a port facility. 
This is reportedly the world’s first non-rectangular football field. 
This unusual football field has proven that designing outside boundaries can help foster creativity used to develop these useful spaces. 
We hope that other communities will adapt this idea to change their own irregular space into an area for organizing various activities, under the concept that “Any abnormal space can achieve the highest benefit.” 
Today, kids of Khlong Toei do not need to go far in order to play football. By providing an opportunity for the youth to interact through sports and by converting an idle space into a valuable community property, this project can serve as a model for other initiatives that seek to revive and improve the quality of living in populated urban centers.

In the Eyes of Hong Kong's Housing Market, We Are All Just Sardines &middot; Global Voices 
In Hong Kong, we are all sardines. Illustration by Disillusionist (CC BY-ND 4.0) 
Hong Kong is notorious for its crowded living conditions and the high cost of residential housing. Generations of housing policies have promised improvements in living standards, but are yet to deliver. 
Cage homes, rooms diced up or subdivided with boards, and the like, used to be the last resort of the city’s poorest. But nowadays even dice-sized apartments can be packaged for the luxury market, as people have become desensitized to the absurdity and have resigned themselves to even more cramped living spaces at unaffordable prices. 
Regardless of the type of housing we occupy, in Hong Kong we are all just sardines. Who Is Duterte? 
He’s called US President Obama a son of a whore. He's been compared to Trump. 
He’s cracked jokes about rape and is open about being a womanizer. His war on drugs has killed thousands of alleged drug dealers and addicts in four months. 
But that’s only half of the story when it comes to the President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte. 
In this week's episode of Into the Deep, a new Global Voices podcast that digs deep into one issue that isn’t getting the media coverage it deserves, Global Voices contributors Mong Palatino and Karlo Mongaya help us unravel the other side of Duterte. 
In this episode, we featured Creative Commons-licensed music from the Free Music Archive, including songs by Blue Dot Sessions called Ray Gun – FasterFasterBrighter and Under Suspicion by Lee Rosevere.

Earlier in March 2017, the Kahoku Shimpo, a Japanese daily newspaper covering northeastern Japan, documented the progress that has been made over the past six years to reconstruct the lives of people affected by the March 2011 "triple disaster" of a massive earthquake, tsunami and the Fukushima nuclear accident. 
The Kahoku Shimpo is headquartered in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, which was one of several prefectures in Japan's northeast that experienced both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami. 
Hundreds of thousands of people Miyagi and its neighbors Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate as the tsunami wiped entire coastal cities off the map. Fukushima Prefecture also experienced a nuclear accident that, alone, forced 160,000 residents to be evacuated from their homes. 
Six years on, the Kahoku Shimpo's special coverage provides a local perspective on what progress has been made rebuilding the lives of people living in the region. The newspaper's in-depth feature includes statistics from Japan's Reconstruction Ministry as well as surveys of evacuees themselves. 
The State of Housing in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate 
The Kahoku Shimpo reports that as of December 2015, 77 per cent of planned replacement housing (災害公営住宅, saigai kouei juutaku) has been completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures. Of the three prefectures Miyagi has experienced the most success, with 80 per cent of planned replacement housing completed. Iwate Prefecture has completed 75 per cent of such housing, while Fukushima lags behind at 70 per cent. 
At the same time, six years on there are still efforts to move evacuees from prefabricated temporary housing (仮設住宅, kasetsu juutaku) to permanent replacement housing. Following the triple disaster, nearly 80,000 people were forced to live in temporary housing. As of December 2016, there were still 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate living in such housing. 
Nearly 40 per cent of 2011 evacuees from Fukushima still live in temporary housing, while Miyagi has been more successful; more than 75 per cent of evacuees residing in prefabricated housing post-disaster have been moved to permanent homes. 
With Iwate, the figure is 34 per cent. 
The State of Work and Day-to-Day Life in the Three Affected Prefectures The Kahoku Shimpo found that 1,074 of 1,100 (or nearly 98 per cent) of schools in three prefectures affected by the March 2011 disaster had been reopened by December 2016. 
Six years on, it's clear that rebuilding industry in the three prefectures has been more difficult. While close to 100 per cent of fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now operational, just 30 per cent of fishing ports have reopened in Fukushima. 
The tsunami and nuclear accident affected a large area of agricultural land in the three prefectures. 
Miyagi has been able to rehabilitate 93 per cent of affected farmland, while just 66 per cent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 per cent of farmland affected by the disaster in Fukushima has returned to use. It's unlikely this is just because of the nuclear accident. 
Tourism has largely rebounded in two of the three prefectures, but, once again, Fukushima still lags. Tourist visitors to Iwate and Miyagi have returned to about 90 per cent of pre-disaster levels, while the number for Fukushima is just 75 per cent. 
However, the Kahoku Shimpo also reports that nearly half of people in coastal settlements feel that earning a livelihood has gotten tougher since the disaster. 
Are Locals Prepared for the Next 'Big One'? 
The paper conducted numerous surveys of local residents and evacuees to determine everything from the state of reconstruction to how perceptions have changed about the risk of tsunamis. In its introduction to the feature, the Kahoku Shimpo explained: 
The survey found that 83.1 per cent of local residents had taken steps to prepare for a future earthquake and tsunami. However, 55.9 per cent of respondents (more than half) still feel not enough has been done to prepare for the next disaster. 
How Evacuees from Fukushima Prefectural Are Faring 
In its anniversary coverage, the Kahoku Shimpo also paid special attention to the status of evacuees from Fukushima Prefecture. 
Besides experiencing the powerful earthquake and devastating tsunami, Fukushima Prefecture also witnessed Japan's worst nuclear accident as a result of the disaster. Out of 160,000 evacuees from Fukushima, nearly 63,000 people were evacuated outside of the prefecture itself. 
As of 2017, approximately 40,000 Fukushima citizens still reside outside of their home prefecture. The majority of evacuees from all areas affected by the disaster who are still living in temporary shelter are over the age of 50, and it's thought one obstacle to moving them back into proper housing is that efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima prefectures are competing against massive construction projects that are part of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. 
31 Years Later, the Lights Come Back on in Chernobyl &middot; Global Voices 
Polish adventurers entered the town of Pripyat in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and turned on lights for the first time since the 1986 nuclear disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. Photo from Napromieniowani's Facebook page. On April 26, 1986, a nuclear meltdown at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in northern Ukraine caused radioactive material to be spewed into the atmosphere, exposing hundreds of thousands—if not millions—of people in Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, and elsewhere in Eastern Europe to extremely high doses of radiation. 
The effects of the nuclear fallout are still being felt: more than 500,000 people in Belarus, the country most affected by the disaster, have thyroid problems stemming from Chernobyl radiation, and more than 2 million people live in areas of the country that put them at high risk of contamination. 
Last week, on the eve of the 31st anniversary of the disaster, a group of Polish adventurers decided to turn the lights back on in Pripyat, a radioactive ghost town located three miles from the Chernobyl reactor. 
Pripyat was evacuated the day after the meltdown and has been abandoned ever since—though it has become the center of the disaster tourism industry that has developed in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. 
The lights come on at a school in Pripyat. 
Using generators, the Poles were able to electrify some of Pripyat's buildings, lighting up the abandoned city for the first time in more than 3 decades. The adventurers posted the photos on the Facebook page they curate, Napromieniowani.pl. This post has been updated to provide proper attribution for the photographs.

How 'Adventurer of the Year' Mira Rai Went From Child Soldier to Ultrarunner &middot; Global Voices Mira Rai, Trail Runner from Nepak.

This story by Anne Bailey originally appeared on PRI.org on April 17, 2017. It is republished here as part of a partnership between PRI and Global Voices. 
Three years ago, Mira Rai didn’t know mountain trail running was a sport. 
Now, this former child soldier from rural Nepal is one of the top long-distance, high-elevation mountain runners in the world. 
And she’s just getting started. 
Rai pulls trophies from a glass case at her house in Kathmandu. I ask her to show me the one from her first trail-running race in Nepal, the one that launched her career three years ago, but she says there wasn’t an award for that one. 
“No trophy,” she laughs. 
The day Rai showed up for that 50-kilometer (about 31 miles) mountain trail race outside Kathmandu, she had no idea what she was getting into. “I went there thinking it was a training run,” explains Rai. 
I just had a T-shirt and pants on. Other runners had backpacks and food and I went with nothing, but I just ran and ran.” Hours later, Rai became the first and only woman to cross the finish line. 
“I just continued to run and then, I didn’t know, but I won!” 
A month later she entered the 180-kilometer Mustang Trail Race in Nepal — that's nearly 112 miles — and won again. Then she took first place in races in Hong Kong, Italy and France. 
And she’s just 29. It’s not a life she imagined for herself. 
Like many rural Nepalis, Rai grew up poor. 
She quit school when she was just 12 years old to help support her family. 
She would carry heavy bags of rice across miles of rugged trails to the local market. "The work was difficult there," says Rai. “The slopes were steep so there wasn’t much cultivation. 
For six months we had food to eat, and for six months we had nothing." In the mountains all around her, a Maoist rebellion had been raging for years. 
But she joined up in hopes of finding a better life for her and her siblings. 
“I went there not because I understood their intentions or policies but because I wanted to do something,” she says. 
Rai saw it as a way to help her siblings — and as a way out for herself. 
“In my village, girls weren’t a priority. 
But the Maoists always talked about equality, which was something I wanted in my own life. 
So I left my education and joined them because I thought I could become something through the training. 
And I did end up learning many new skills.” Like how to shoot assault weapons. She also became a black belt in karate and excelled at running. 
Rai told her mother when she left that she’d be gone for a week. It was more like two years. 
When the armed conflict ended in 2006 under a UN-brokered peace agreement, Rai was 17. She thought she’d continue as a soldier in the Nepali army, but she was considered too young. So she returned to her village, devastated. She stayed in touch with her karate instructor from the Maoist camp, however, and focused on keeping herself physically fit. 
He eventually invited her to live with his family in Kathmandu. And now, every morning at 6 a.m., she stretches and practices at his dojo. 
A few miles away, a group of Nepali girls say the same thing about Mira Rai. 
At a local running club, girls here take turns telling me why they like running, and what Rai told them the day she visited their club. 
“She said 'never give up,'” one girl reports. 
“And she told us that running is also good for our health." 
Girls in the Himalayan Children’s Foundation running club in Kathmandu, Nepal, say they’re inspired by Mira Rai’s success in sports. 
I ask the running club if it’s easy to do sports as a girl in Nepal. They all shake their heads: No. 
Rai knows that sports alone won’t change things in Nepal’s conservative society — especially in the rural areas. 
"We are considered backward just because we are women," Rai explains. “But we’re not backward. We should be involved in sports, and we should make our country known for that.” 
Unfortunately, Nepal’s government has barely acknowledged Rai’s success and doesn’t view mountain racing as a sport. 
“It's sad that everybody says mountain racing is a sport, but in my own country, the government doesn’t recognize it," she says. But as usual, Rai isn’t giving up. 
"I want to transfer the chance I got to my little sisters in Nepal. 
I want to help them learn what I learned and reach where I am today," she says. 
"I want them to have as big a name as mine someday.”

Witch Doctors’ Latest Victims Are Bald Men in Mozambique, Police Say &middot; Global Voices 
Police in Zambézia warn the population that bald men in Mozambique could be the target of attacks. Photo: Anders Bolin/Flickr, CC-BY-NC 2.0 
A new phenomenon of kidnapping bald people for organ trafficking, reportedly for superstitious reasons, is worrying the police in Mozambique’s Zambézia province, whose government launched a series of operations to curb the practice. At the beginning of June, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the Malawian border. 
Two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs were to be used by witch doctors in Tanzania and Malawi. The motive behind the killings is local superstitions which hold that the head of a bald man contains gold or can bring riches, a Zambézia’s police spokesperson told the BBC. 
This is the first time bald men have been the subject of recorded attacks in Mozambique. 
But there have been other instances in the country where killings motivated by dark magic have been reported, particularly affecting albino people. The situation became so dire that the United Nations was compelled to conduct a mission in 2016 to investigate the practice in the Southeast African nation. 
The persecution of people with albinism has been reported in other countries in Southern Africa, in particular neighbouring Tanzania, where the government has been developing campaigns to combat superstition and prejudice and arresting suspects. 
In Mozambique, some people took to social media to discuss this latest attacks against bald men in the country. 
Warning for bald men travelling to Mozambique Bald men in Mozambique are being targeted by ritual attacks, the Mozambican police warned, after the recent killing of three bald men for body parts. 
Two suspects were arrested in the central district of Milange, where the murders happened. Hussene Algy Adamo, a student living in the city of Inhambane, in southern Mozambique, said that the local police were already dealing with the case: 
PRM believes witch doctors are involved in the death of bald men. The tracking and murder of bald individuals for the theft and sale of their organs, in Morrumbala district, Zambézia province, for presumed superstitious rituals, has cultural motivations and is ordered by traditional healers, the Police of the Republic of Mozambique (PRM) believes, which also indicates the existence of a belief that the victims have, in the head, some power which generates wealth. 
In recent days, three men with problems with baldness were killed in that part of the country. Angela Ferreira Samantha shared on Facebook a report by the blogger Armen Snaippa, who suggested that the issue is part of the larger social challenges affecting Mozambique: 
I WOULD LIKE A MOZAMBIQUE WITH A SENSE OF SHAME A country where people were ashamed to go outside dressed as if it was a porn movie shoot, where the teachers were ashamed to ask for sex in exchange for grades and the students were ashamed to offer sex for grades, jobs, and other benefits, a nation where the people looked for honest jobs and did not have to hurt or even take the lives of others to earn their bread, a country where neither albinos nor bald people were hunted for dark practices or “black magic” aimed at easy enrichment. 
Despite the seriousness of the events, some did not miss the chance for a bit of macabre humor. Zenaida Machado, a researcher with Human Rights Watch in Angola and Mozambique, and an avid Twitter user, took to the platform to point out that the Morrumbala district chief Pedro Sapange and Zambezia police spokesman Inácio Dina were both bald. 
Flooding in Jamaica, August 2007.

Three days of heavy rains associated with a trough caused chaos and disaster in many parts of Jamaica between May 14 and 17, 2017, raising burning questions over poor planning and development, badly designed and inadequate drainage systems, and Jamaicans' continued careless solid waste disposal practices. 
As Jamaicans start to pick up the pieces, the government has much work to do in counting the cost of the damage &#8212; including a review of the island's arrangements with the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility, which is the first multi-country risk pool in the world, designed "as a regional catastrophe fund for Caribbean governments to limit the financial impact of devastating hurricanes and earthquakes by quickly providing financial liquidity when a policy is triggered." 
Jamaica has not benefitted from the facility over the last ten years, because the natural disasters it has experienced have not qualified for payouts. However, the damage to infrastructure from the rain was considerable. 
In rural areas, many roads were blocked by floods and landslides, communities marooned and several bridges swept away. 
There was a landslide (the second to date) on a section of the Chinese-built North-South Highway linking the capital, Kingston, to Montego Bay. The extreme weather was not connected with any storm system, but the local Meteorological Office noted: 
Antigua's Met Office tweeted: 
An interesting satellite annimation of the extreme (#flooding) rainfall across the western #Caribbean this past week. pic.twitter.com/GrKzC9QP7V — Antigua Met Service (@anumetservice) May 20, 2017 
Local media did a great job of reporting from rural areas:

Meanwhile, in town, Kingston's mayor Delroy Williams went on an eye-opening tour of a community where a large gully, choked with debris, opens into the sea: 
Stop #6 The source of the flooding at the school. We cannot continue to dump in drains and gullies. In the end we are affected. pic.twitter.com/5cNUhE0skp — Delroy Williams (@MayorWilliamsJA) May 16, 2017

Other politicians rushed to their constituencies to survey the damage, complaining or making excuses about blocked drains, and making sure that their presence was noted via social media:

Be extremely careful pic.twitter.com/JlPYfLefsU — Jamaica Weather (@jamaicaweather) May 16, 2017 
While some technical experts suggested an inadequate drainage system was partly responsible, observers on Twitter noted: 
The mayor of Kingston also tweeted his concerns that things might not get any better if extreme weather events become more common: 
@IReggaeDay @MetserviceJA We however need to assess our drainage capacity and town planning &amp; see if this unprecedented rain will become the norm due to G.Warming — Delroy Williams (@MayorWilliamsJA) May 17, 2017 
Most schools closed for at least one day, while students struggled to reach examination centers to take external exams. The minister of education tweeted: 
While emergency services worked hard to bring things back to normal, one government agency &#8212; the National Water Commission &#8212; celebrated with cheerful music: 
What a #waterview! 
The Hermitage Dam is now 100% of capacity! pic.twitter.com/RQu9dEhAQD — NWCJamaica (@NWCjam) May 15, 2017 Poorly planned housing developments and highways were cited as major contributors to the devastating floods, with one geologist observing that while many useful surveys have been done and the problems identified, the data is not being used to inform decisions to correct those problems. 
A lack of proper maintenance was also cited. 
On Twitter, many agreed with activist Carol Narcisse's comment: We will never have enough money to clean drains&amp;gullies at the rate that garbage is dumped in them. 
Meanwhile, the Jamaica Environment Trust (JET) took the opportunity to reinforce its ongoing campaign "Nuh Dutty Up Jamaica" (Don't Dirty Up Jamaica) with its catchy song and clever video. 
Global climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events like this one. 
Unless we change our daily habits and development practices, we can expect high financial and social costs to life, livelihoods and property to continue. 
Accepting individual responsibility for the garbage we produce is one way for every Jamaican citizen to do this. 
At the same time, the state must also take a lead role in improving the way our towns and cities are managed, with better solid waste infrastructure, preservation of green spaces and enforcement of planning laws and regulations. 
We must also take the protection of our forests much more seriously at the individual and state level if we are to have any hope of mitigating the threat of Climate Change. As citizens clean up, they're casting blame in various directions, while officials tally the damage, including the worrying impact on the national budget. 
Both the government and Jamaica's people are in for some tough changes, as climate change continues to impact the region's fragile island nations, forcing difficult choices. VIDEO: How Do Japanese Cats Stay Warm in Winter? With ‘Kotatsus’, Just Like Humans &middot; Global Voices 
A cat in a 'kotatsu.' 
From the Kagoneko YouTube channel. Winter has arrived in Japan. On Thursday, November 24, Tokyo experienced its first November snowfall in 54 years. 
While the snow may have been unexpected, it does herald the start of an uncomfortable season in Japan: winter. 
While the torrid summer months can be made bearable thanks to ubiquitous air conditioning, Japan's chilly winter months can be cruel. This is because central heating is not as widespread in Japan as it is in other developed countries. 
Instead, many people rely on kerosene space heaters to keep warm, as well as something called a kotatsu—a low wooden table outfitted with a heavy blanket, and warmed by a heater underneath. 
The word kotatsu conjures up images of coziness and warmth, and not just for humans. 
Google Mapping of Public Toilets Is the Latest Effort to Stop Open Defecation in India &middot; Global Voices A public toilet in India. 
Image from Flickr by Rezwan. CC BY-NC-SA 
Access to public toilets in India is a perennial problem. Almost half of India's 1.2 billion people, especially in rural areas, lack flush toilet facilities inside their home and have to defecate in the open or in dry, unhygienic pits. 
The practice of open defecation leads to other problems &#8212; it fuels harassment of women and girls, keeps inhumane practices like manual scavenging (cleaning human waste by hand) alive, and spread diseases such as diarrhea and encephalitis. 
In an effort to put an end to open defecation, Google and the Indian government have teamed up to map public toilets in India to help citizens locate usable ones near them. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed to build more than 12 million toilets across India by 2019 as a part of his ambitious Swachh Bharat (Clean India) mission. But building toilets is the easy part &#8212; convincing people to use them is the real challenge. 
There is still a long way to go in terms of educating people about hygiene. 
Not to mention, maintaining a public toilet clean and usable takes work, and sometimes you aren't able to find one when you need it most. 
Now, Google and India's Ministry of Urban Development have developed a toilet locator tool within Google Maps that offers the location, address and opening hours of a few thousand communal and public toilets in the Indian capital Delhi and a few other cities. The initiative launched in New Delhi and the state of Madhya Pradesh on December 22, and soon will be expanded to other places in India. 
Toilet locations are marked "swachh public toilet" on Google Maps. Each restroom also includes a description of if it is free to use, what kind of toilet it is (a squat toilet or a western-style pot), and a star rating to help users locate the cleaner ones. Cool! Now, getting around #India just got lighter! #Google #Maps launches public toilet locator! https://t.co/3V07h0RsDK — C. S. Prakash (@AgBioWorld) December 23, 2016 
Some Indians poked fun at the initiative: 
Dear Google, just ensure that you dont show every household in your map as a place for public toilet https://t.co/xgmBo2phxl — KARTHIK S (@karthiks_india) December 22, 2016 
While on the news site Quartz India, Ananya Bhattacharya cautioned for people to treat the potential of the feature realistically: 
It would be naive to think Google’s efforts will change attitudes and rectify India’s sanitation troubles altogether, especially since nearly 900 million Indians don’t have access to the internet, which is necessary to view the map. 
But for those who want and are able to reach a nearby toilet, the maps could prove to be a real asset. As open defecation is an issue elsewhere in the world, it will be interesting to see if Google Maps implements this feature globally.

The Himalayan country of Nepal has always fascinated trekkers, climbers, wildlife lovers and adrenaline junkies. However, if you’re a lepidopterist, it’s the perfect place to follow your passion. Nepal boasts of having more than 650 species of butterflies, accounting for 3.72 per cent of world’s butterfly species. 
Butterflies are found everywhere in Nepal – from the jungles in the southern plains to the mountains in the northern part. 
The hills around the Kathmandu Valley are good areas for spotting the winged creatures. 
Winner of many national photo competitions, Shrestha told Global Voices: “The butterfly habitat is decreasing day by day due to increasing human population.” 
Bitten by the bug of nature and wildlife photography, Shrestha continues to capture the butterflies and plans to produce a coffee table book to showcase Nepal’s beauty and promote tourism in the country. 
Here are some of the butterflies he has shot with his camera in different parts of Nepal.

Shrestha isn't the only one documenting Nepal's butterflies. A British national, Colin Smith, spent more than 50 years studying butterflies in Nepal. He traveled to 40 districts collecting 25,000 butterflies and wrote the book Illustrated Checklist of Nepal’s Butterflies. 
The butterflies collected by Smith &#8212; aka ‘Putali Baje’ meaning ‘Butterfly Granddad’ in Nepali &#8212; have been displayed at Natural History Museum, Kathmandu; Annapurna Butterfly Museum, Pokhara; and at Kathmandu University in Dhulikhel.

Around the world, urban agriculture is playing a role in feeding a growing global population from mid-America to the Middle East. 
Abu Nasser has created a 200-square-meter (2,000-square-foot) micro-farm using a hydroponic system and homemade organic pest-control solutions consisting of garlic, pepper, soap and more. 
Each year, he produces approximately 3,500 kilograms (7,700 pounds) of food — enough to feed 30 people. Perhaps more important, though, his urban farm may be a model for others hoping to grow food sustainably at smaller scales.

The five-day market rotating around Shan State’s Inle Lake area is famous for its rustic, bustling scenes, as tradespeople of different ethnic backgrounds, including Intha and Pa-O, migrate daily from one site to another to sell their produce and ware. 
The market calendar is lunar: there are no markets on full and black moon days. On the west side of the lake, about a one-hour drive from Nyaung Shwe, Thandaung village has a less touristic market day than Indein and Nampan.

We're Living Longer, But Not Everyone Is Living Healthier &middot; Global Voices 
Infographic about changes in bad health that mya be expected in South America, used with permission. 
Medigo, a health-specialized platform that connects patients and physicians all over the world, has completed a comparative global study on life expectancy. 
On average, human beings live longer today than ever before. Nearly every country on the planet has seen an increase in life expectancy since the beginning of the 21st century, with the global average reaching 71.4 years in 2015. 
But there are huge variations in life expectancy between and within nations, as well. 
In Europe and North America, the average is 73 years, in Oceania it is 71, in Latin America is 70 years, in Asia is 61 years, and in Africa it is just 55 years. Medigo, however, decided to take its analysis a step further and ask the question: 
The World Health Organization confirms that we are living longer, but are we living healthier? Healthy Life Expectancy, or HALE, is what the World Health Organization uses to measure how many years an individual can expect to live while maintaining a healthy lifestyle. 
Influenced by factors like quality of healthcare, hygiene, wars, and more, HALE still fails to take into account violent deaths. This rating has registered improvements in recent years. 
Those gains reverse declines during the 1990s, when life expectancy fell in Africa because of the AIDS epidemic and in Eastern Europe following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Using infographics, Medigo offers an alternative measurement for global health that it calls “Bad Health Years,” showing changes worldwide since 2000. 
Infographics about changes during bad health years to be expected in the world, used with permission. 
Basically we take the total life expectancy, which is just how much we are expected to live and is determined at birth, and we deducted the healthy-life-expectancy years from the actual life expectancy. 
After doing this, we see the average amount of years someone can expect to live in bad health: “Bad Health Years.” Bad Health Years are the years you live with diseases and disabilities. 
You can find all Medigo's infographics on its website. 
A Nepali Wildlife Photographer Uses His Camera to Raise Awareness About Conservation &middot; Global Voices 
Wallowing rhino, Chitwan. Image by Sagar Giri. Used with permission. 
Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos that he saw around him – blurry, with subjects poorly positioned and washed-out colors. So, he was motivated to carry a camera of his own and try to fix the situation. That was when he was a child. 
He explained on Facebook how this prime location helps him with his work: I live on edge of the World Heritage Site Chitwan National Park, what can be better for a wildlife Photographer enthusiast!! 
So, today i was resting at my place and suddenly Navaraj (Manager at Chitwan Gaida Lodge) calls me, he got my dad's call that there is the leopard at the bank of Rapti river. The River dam just a few minutes away at the touristic place of Sauraha. 
My Dad had been watching him, showed me the place across the River a long Distance where Leopard was and immediately my shutter burst began!! Sagar aspires to work with the government to get Nepal's nature recognized worldwide and wants to create awareness that wild animals are not fearsome as they look. And he should know &#8212; he's had encounters with tigers: A tiger doesn't lose sleep over the opinion of sheep!! 
Late evening too low on the light. 
Home time for all the animals &amp; birds. I was also returning home coz of darkness, then suddenly appears the King from the Bushes, immediately sits when we both see each other &amp; Stares at me through the sal trees!! 
Seeing the need to protect wild animals, Sagar puts the logo “i click for conservation” in his pictures. His passion for promoting the nature and wildlife of Nepal, however, isn’t always easy. He has waited for 22 days to shoot photos of otters in Bardia National Park living mostly in a tent, and up to 12 days to capture images of tigers, and six to seven days to get a perfect shot of birds living in nearby lodges. 
Take a look at some of his photos below.

Deadly Floods in Bangladesh, India and Nepal Wreak Havoc &middot; Global Voices 
A series of terrible floods in Bangladesh, India and Nepal are disrupting lives of hundreds of thousands of people, displacing them and causing serious damage to property and infrastructure. 
Heavy monsoon rain in southern Nepal and northern India caused flash floods and landslides, and the flood waters swept across downstream rivers in Bangladesh, killing at least 175 people in these three countries. 
At least 6 million people were affected by the floods in Nepal's Terai region and more than 48,000 homes were submerged. 
A section of the Mahendra Highway, the most important east-west connection in Nepal, was washed away by torrential rains. 
The telecommunications and electricity services were down and connecting roads had been washed away. People are sharing images and videos of the devastation on social media.

At least 99 people died and over 2 million people were affected across 21 districts of the Indian state of Assam. 
This is the third wave of flooding since the start of the 2017 monsoon.

More than 1 million people had been affected by flooding after rivers burst their banks following days of heavy rain in Bangladesh. Experts predict that the country is headed for a major flood, similar to the one in 1988.

August 15 marked the 72nd anniversary of the end of the Second World War. 
On the occasion, Japan remembered the 2.3 million Japanese military personnel and military employees and 800,000 Japanese civilians who died between the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 and the end of World War II in 1945. 
Japan's annual commemoration of the end of the war shows that, seven decades on, there is no clear political consensus in Japan about how to remember the war. 
Some remember the 3.1 million dead while seeming to avoid the context of the war in which they died, while others are committed to preserving the memory of how destructive war can be, and the need for Japan to continue to embrace pacifism. 
More than 6,200 people attended a memorial service at the Nippon Budokan sports arena in Tokyo, which featured remarks by Prime Minister Abe Shinzo and Japanese Emperor Akihito. Abe's words were notable in that he did not express Japan's guilt for starting the war, while the emperor expressed feelings of "deep remorse" for the war, for the third year in a row. 
Neither made direct reference to the war dead in other countries. 
Full remarks made by the Emperor at the Memorial Ceremony for the War Dead: http://www.kunaicho.go.jp/page/okotoba/detailEn/14#92 
Meanwhile, thousands of people traveled to Yasukuni Shrine and neighboring Chidorigafuchi National Cemetery in Tokyo to pay their respects to the war dead. Yasukuni Shrine is controversial for many people across East Asia since the shrine memorializes, among others, convicted Japanese war criminals. As well, swords forged at Yasukuni were used in the battlefields across Asia between 1933 and 1945. 
BuzzFeed Japan reporter Kota Hatachi reported from the scene: 
The 72nd anniversary of the end of the war. On assignment, I traveled to Yasukuni Shrine and Chidorigafuchi National Cemetery. As a light rain fell, a long line of visitors stretched through the muggy precincts of Yasukuni Shrine. Meanwhile, protesters and other groups congregated outside of Yasukuni. 
According to Sankei Shimbun newspaper, the groups were demonstrating against attempts to revise Japan's "peace Constitution" as well raising awareness about a variety of issues, such as Taiwanese independence. 
Due to the crush of Yasukuni visitors and the sheer number of protesters and other groups nearby, Tokyo police erected barricades to control the crowds. 
End-of-War Memorial Day: Many groups assembled around Yasukuni Shrine. 
Tokyo Metropolitan Police issued warnings Sankei Shimbun also reported that right-wing and conservative counter-demonstrators appeared in response to Yasukuni demonstrators, prompting police to separate the two groups. 
Elsewhere in Tokyo, other groups marked the day by coming out in support of Article 9 of Japan's Constitution, in which Japan renounces war and which the Abe government is seeking to revise or even abolish. August 15, #EndOfTheWarDay At 5 p.m. we will met at Zōshiki Station to reaffirm our vow . A main theme of the day was that memories of the hardship of war appear to be disappearing as the wartime generation ages: 
The average age of surviving spouses of soldiers killed in the war has now increased to 94. 
Passing on the memory from generation to generation is becoming more difficult. At person who was 8 years old at the end of the war is now 80. 
A young man who was eligible for conscription then is now 92. 
There are just a few people left who know the experience of living through war. Today's politicians and business people and students know nothing of war. We must preserve the desire to study the experiences and awareness of those who lived the history of war. 
Article: "Japan's Pattern of Defeat"—According to historian Isoda Michifumi, it's important for Japanese people to "think deeply." 
The significance of the day wasn't lost on this Japanese Twitter user, however: 
To continue to live in peace. 
Indigenous Nepali Language With Only Two Fluent Speakers Sees Pages of Hope in Newly Launched Dictionary &middot; Global Voices Gyani Maiya Sen is one of the two fluent Kusunda language speakers. 
Screenshot from a video by Felix Gaedtke. A newly launched book-cum dictionary of the Kusunda language, one of several endangered languages in Nepal, is helping prevent the language from dying out with a whimper. 
Though the 2011 Census shows the population of Kusunda people in Nepal as 273 and indicates 28 people speaking the Kusunda language as their mother tongue, field studies suggest there are actually only 150 Kusundas of which only two people are fluent speakers of the language. 
Kusunda language is an oral language without any script and there are no written records, documents or books available. 
The living Kusundas dispersed to different parts of the country and they do not get the opportunity to speak in their mother tongue. 
They had to assimilate in ways of life and cultural practices of the places where they live now. 
As a result, the Kusundas do not even speak their mother tongue at home. 
According to Uday Raj Aale, the author of the book, the only two fluent speakers alive are Gyani Maiya Sen Kusunda, 81, from Deukhuri, Dang and Kamala Sen Khatri, 48, from Rolpa. Currently, Kusundas live in the Kapilvastu, Arghakhanchi, Pyuthan, Rolpa, Dang, and Surkhet districts of Nepal. Jacket of the book on Kusundas. 
Used with permission. 
The Kusundas, known as Ban Raja (kings of the forest), led a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the hill forests of Nepal’s central and mid-western development regions until only few decades ago. Their lifestyle, patterns of habitation, and the distinct and unique Kusunda language suggest that they have been living in Nepal since ancient times. 
The Kusundas also refer to themselves as 'kings of the forest', albeit in the Kusunda language, rendered Gilangdei Myahak and claim equal status and relationship to the Thakuris, the ruling clan in Nepal. According to the Kusundas, the Thakuris are kings of cultivated land, while they have dominion over wooded lands. 
Kusundas have typically taken Thakuri surnames such as Shahi, Sen, and Khan. The book by Aaley talks about the history, language, culture, and tradition of the Kusundas and has a collection of more than 2,500 words from the Kusunda language. However, Aaley is not the only person studying the Kusundas. Brian Houghton Hodgson, Johan Reinhard, David Watters, B.K. Rana and Madhav Prasad Pokharel are among the other academics that have worked to shed light on the mysterious language. 
This video made by Felix Gaedtke and Gayatri Parameswaran features interviews with Gyani Maiya Sen, her son and Professor Pokharel from Tribhuvan University’s Central Department of Linguistics. 
This year’s local elections brought some good news for Kusundas. Dhan Bahadur Kusunda, founder of the Nepal Kusunda Development Society, was selected as a representative for the executive committee for the municipality of Ghorahi, Nepal’s seventh largest city, under the marginalized community category quota. 
While the Kusunda language is still effectively facing extinction, the representation of Kusundas in local government and efforts like the compiling of the Kusunda dictionary will help to preserve the Kusunda culture and tradition as well as the language itself. Offbeat 'Objets d'Art' Are Rather Commonplace in Japan &middot; Global Voices 
Image license: Attribution 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0). 
A blogger by the name of bluebluelucky at the Japanese curation site Naver Matome, has collected some of Japan's strangest "objets d'art" from social media users all around the country. 
When walking around town, especially in parks and playgrounds, you often see strange 'objets d'art'. Wondering who and what are they for, I gathered some images together, although I am still not sure of the answer. 
The sculptures are typically puzzling, often weird, and sometimes even a little menacing: 
Here's a report from our field trip ♫: (Kawaguchi Athletic Park) The panda chewing on bamboo is a horrible sight. While not as many people have come to see this panda as a result of the 2007 Niigata earthquake, thanks to a TV show that introduced this panda, more and more people are coming to see it (again). 
This particular sculpture (apparently a pump for a well) is supposed to resemble Doraemon, Japan's most beloved anime character, but, as is typical with playground sculptures in Japan, there's something a little off: 
There are a lot of things wrong with this objet d'art (?) at the local park. 
Odd-looking animals are not at all unusual in Japan's parks and playgrounds: 
This lion at the local park is totally nuts! 
Rural tourist attractions in Japan can also harbor some very odd (and some might say creepy) statuary: 
Miyamidori Park, Miyazaki: Quite close to Ikoma Highlands there's Japan's best wild boar restaurant. 
There's also Japan's spookiest public park. I'm not sure if it's from the person who ran the park in the past, but outside the restaurant there's a statue of a mother and child *and* a giant statue of Prince Osu, plus a statue of a wild boar. 
The statues are all kind of weather-beaten, too. Found in Miyamidori Park. 
This used to be in Japan's spookiest park which is now closed. Man, I wanted to go to that park. 
Some, however, are just strange. I went to Toki Premium Outlet Mall in Gifu Prefecture. There's a strange objet d'art nearby that I could not resist taking a picture of. 
It's called KAGUYA-SYSTEM. 
It gives me the creeps. 
In fact, many visitors to Japan have likely encountered the country's most famous objet d'art, otherwise known as "the hot dog guy": 
Check out even more unusual Japanese objets d'art at Naver Matome. 
This story is based on a talk given by the author on July 15, 2017 at the TEDx Youth@AmaatraAcademy in Bangalore, India. 
It was during the winter of 2014. I was at home, researching the storytelling patterns of my community. 
I spent days trying to persuade my grandma to tell me some of the stories from her time. But she’s always been moody, and she wouldn’t comply. 
Then one morning, out of the blue, she started telling me stories. 
After the first one, I had this gut feeling that I had to record it, even though I didn’t know how I would use it. So I covertly took out my camera and started shooting. 
I had a great time recording these unique songs and stories of my community. I uploaded them and made them available publicly online. 
How languages die Languages are influenced by contact with other languages. 
The fate of our languages is also decided by socio-politics. For instance, public policies determine that certain languages become the standard in education, scientific research, and governance, while others are left to die a slow death. Because it's not obviously profitable to create media in “minority" languages, the growth and enrichment of those languages suffer, and many remain entirely undocumented. 
Much less is known about the original scripts of the languages of these parts of the world. Fortunately, scholars have studied and documented some of these languages and writing systems, and their work allows us today to discover many fascinating stories from those cultures. 
While it is interesting and advantageous to know more than one language, our native language is particularly important, as it is the tool in which we most easily encode and decode our emotions, our stories, and our secrets. If we don’t start documenting languages digitally—especially the endangered ones—we may lose the colourful diversity of human civilisation. 
Languages can also be important repositories for indigenous knowledge—knowledge that is relevant to modern society. It’s up to us, as speakers of minority languages, to decide how long we want to keep our languages alive. 
Languages can unite people! 
The festival involves lots of dancing, feasting, and drinking of locally-brewed spirits, and it's also a place for young people to find their future spouses. The thing that fascinated me most about Cho Mang Kan, however, is that my community has a comparable festival, and similar festivals exist across South and East Asia. 
Even though I read about these festivals before, experiencing it in person in a different community felt like a rediscovering a part of myself. We might not look the same, and speak different languages, but deep down inside we are closely connected. 
So here you have young people using augmented reality, deep learning, and artificial intelligence to—albeit inadvertently—help a marginalized language stay alive. The lesson here is that people don’t need to make language documentation their religion—there are fun, creative ways you can use language that so the same thing. 
It would be great, however, if these activities were taking place outside of private spaces like Snapchat, as we desperately need more of this kind of content on public digital platforms. 
How you can help 
So, I want to leave you with four ways to consider for creatively documenting languages you hear around you: 
1. When you meet someone new, show a little curiosity and ask them what language they speak with their grandparents. 
Ask them to tell you a story, sing a song or just say a few words, and record it. 
2. Use the tools you already love and use—Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter?—and host a live session on social media where you invite a guest to narrate a story or teach you a traditional game of their community, and record the session. 3. 
Share your recordings publicly under an open license that allows others to make use of your work in a way that allows them to credit you without having to request permission each time. 
I would personally recommend the Creative Commons licenses, as most multimedia platforms like Vimeo and YouTube allow them. There are also open source platforms like the Wikimedia Commons, Internet Archive, and ma where you can upload your recordings along with tags and metadata that make the content searchable. Three researchers from the University of Washington recently conducted an experiment using public domain video and audio files of President Obama’s speeches. 
They used artificial intelligence to manipulate the videos so Obama appeared to be lip-syncing to the pre-recorded audio. The result was fascinating and surprisingly realistic, but they could do this only because those videos and audio files bore a public domain license. 4. 
Dear Tanzanian Cinephiles, Your Local Film Industry Needs Your Support &middot; Global Voices 
The cast and crew of T-Junction, a Tanzanian film that won three awards at the 20th edition of the Zanzibar International Film Festival. Photo courtesy of Amil Shivji. 
On June 16, 2017, the 20th edition of the Zanzibar International Film Festival (ZIFF) concluded with an illustrious awards night that saw my film, T-Junction, honoured with the most important award of the night: Best Feature Film. Altogether we bagged three awards, including Best Actress for Hawa Ally, the film's lead actress. 
Considering the number of international films screened at the festival and the many delegates and filmmakers that attended, I should be overflowing with joy after such a success. 
Filmmaking in Tanzania dates back to the government-funded productions in the 1980s, but the "Bongo movies" phenomenon, as we call our home-grown films, came into its own in the early 2000s. 
The industry now is second only to Nigeria in terms of the volume of production, with some sources suggesting that there are around 500 films produced locally every year. It's for these reasons I expected to see many more of my fellow citizens at the festival. 
I wanted to be a journalist. As I was getting ready to go to university, I stumbled upon an advertisement for a scholarship for African students at York University in Toronto. I applied, and in due course, I received an email informing me that I had won. 
As I immersed myself in the history of film, my focus shifted to Third Cinema, the movement for revolutionary filmmaking from globally marginalised countries that emerged in the 1960-70s in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Those films from the 60s, to me, were a true reflection of the disenfranchisement of people, and the filmmakers who came up in that tradition truly used the moving image to fight against oppression. 
That realisation moved me to do the same for this era, and for my country, especially as I believe this to be an age of aggressive neoliberal attacks and dwindling spaces for advocacy. ZIFF, to me, has become home court for those kinds of narratives. It offers me, and other Tanzanian filmmakers, a refuge, and the festival is sensitive to our needs as visual artists. 
So the absence of many of the "Bongo" movie stars at the festival, the ones whose faces I regularly encounter on DVD covers on the streets of Dar es Salaam, I question whether we can truly call our film sector an industry. By labelling it as such while we still lack the foundation and cohesive structure that a real industry requires, we may be jumping the gun. 
Some of them would argue that travelling to Zanzibar is expensive, and that may very well be true. But once you come to terms with the fact that you want to spend your life making movies, you must also get used to ignoring the statement that "funding is an issue". 
The buzzword in our market these days is "entrepreneur", and I find many of my students and young people casually throwing that term around. Yet they refuse to live by it and what it means. 
Tanzania is blessed with countless stories and young people craving the chance to tell them. If we truly want to build an industry, we must move beyond individual ambitions and think about a more collaborative and collective future. 
Supporting indigenous festivals like ZIFF is one place to start. 
Japanese calligrapher Bisen Aoyagi at the Japan Expo in Thailand in 2016. 
Screencap from official Bisen Aoyagi YouTube Channel. A recent viral tweet demonstrated how much Japanese popular culture values the art of writing and showcased an up-and-coming calligrapher who has garnered a host of fans because of her personality and penmanship. 
In mid-September, Aoyagi Bisen posted a video to her Twitter account that showed how to write what is widely regarded to be one of the most obscure-and complex-Chinese characters: biang, used exclusively when writing "biangbiang noodles" in Mandarin. 
From the perspective of anyone who is familiar with writing Chinese characters, known in Japanese as kanji, the character for biang is almost ridiculously complicated, taking 56 strokes to write. 
Aoyagi's video has been shared on Twitter so far more than 149,000 times. 
Here is the one Chinese character that is said to be the most complicated. It's used in China! ( ´ ▽ ` )ﾉ The character is read as "biang", and is used when writing the name of the noodle dish known as biangbiang-men (^ ^)！ The character was written using an original Bisen brush and hanshiyo paper. 
Born in Osaka, Aoyagi says in her official bio that she started learning Japanese calligraphy from the age of four from her grandmother. 
Here is a new profile picture of me. 
On Twitter, Aoyagi regularly posts short videos of beautiful calligraphy demonstrations. To shine! #AoyagiBisen 
How to write beautiful Chinese characters. #aoyagibisen 
And other times, Aoyagi provides virtuoso performances that more resemble abstract art. In this tweet, Aoyagi challenges herself to write a 108-stroke abstract form made up of different kanji elements. 
A kanji with 108 strokes. 
To help shoo away some "earthly desires", here's a time challenge. Wouldn't it be awesome if I could write this in one go in a minute or less? 
Follow Aoyagi Bisen on Twitter and Instagram to see more artwork and kanji demonstrations. Her website also features some more of her calligraphy, some of which is for sale. The Unusual, Sometimes Mysterious Bookmarks Found in Used Books in Japan &middot; Global Voices 
A used bookstore in Fukui, Japan. 
Photo by Nevin Thompson. 
Have you ever bought a book at a secondhand bookstore and found something unexpected left inside that the previous owner used as bookmark? 
If you have, you are not alone. Unusual bookmarks left in used books seems to be a global phenomenon, and a blog post written by someone with the Naver Matomer username of "Outstanding Individual Talent In 28 Seconds" (28秒に一人の逸材さん) catalogs what some of these bookmarks look like in Japan. 
Many of the bookmarks, before being shared on Twitter as photographs, were found in titles purchased at Book Off, a nationwide chain of used bookstores in Japan. 
I finished reading Otsuichi's book "Summer, Fireworks, and My Dead Body", a book I finally found in Book Off, on the train ride home. The author described some very graphic things indifferently, and the ending made me gape out of goriness, but the scariest thing was the doodle that was between the last pages. 
Other bookmarks showcased in the Naver Matome blog post are cryptic and sometimes unsettling. 
There was a paper in my second-hand book with a mysterious code on it... I'm seriously scared. 
This handmade (a cutout of a supermarket ad) bookmark in my second-hand book is so cool. 
There are bookmarks that seem to somehow match the book they were found in: 
Holy crap, this copy of Dogra Magra I bought at Book Off has something in it. 
There's a Hello Kitty (Sanrio) bookmark. 
And on the bookmark are hard-to-read characters with little pronunciation guides written next to them. 
Used books are awesome! Sometimes there are unexpected rewards to be found at Book Off: 
So I bought a book at Book Off for 108 yen (about US$1) and there was 4,000 yen (about US$40) inside it. 
But why was it both the old and the new 1,000-yen bills? 
Whatever, I came out ahead. Or even hints at the life of the previous owner of the book. 
This was in some manga I bought at Book Off. 
The photos were taken on March 19, 1995. 
More odd bookmarks can be found in the Naver Matome blog post.

That said, we would like to give recognition to the great work of websites like the Digital Archive of National Film Library, Cinetecavirtual.cl, Cinépata.com and the University of Santiago's Patrimonial Archive. Also, we have added films from many filmmakers that have uploaded their work onto the web. Documentary: Lost in the Ruins of Georgia's Soviet-Era Tea Industry &middot; Global Voices 
The former director of the Laituri tea factory looks out over the ruins of what was once a thriving plantation. 
Screenshot from Chai-khana.org documentary. The following is a version of a partner post originally titled 'God, Thank You for Tea!' that first appeared on the website Chai-Khana.org. 
In the 1950s Laituri, a village of 2697 residents, buzzed with life. 
Georgians, Russians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis flocked to the rural centre in western Georgia to work on the tea plantations that used to dot the region during the Soviet Union. The break-up of the USSR sent the production into freefall - families were left without a vital income and Laituri’s kaleidoscope of languages, religions, ethnicities faded and disappeared. Today scores of locals have turned into seasonal migrants who travel to pick tea in neighbouring Turkey’s fields. God, Thank You For Tea tells the story of those whose lives were shaped by these scented tea plantations. 
'The Position of Women in Science Has Changed for the Better', but 'Is Still Far From Ideal' &middot; Global Voices 
Shilpa Iyer with her permission 
As part of a two-pronged series of interviews with medical researchers based in Africa (read the first part here), Global Voices reached out to Dr. Shilpa Iyer, who is currently working in Zambia. Iyer grew up in Pune, India, where she obtained her bachelor's and masters degrees in zoology and molecular biology, respectively. 
She is currently a postdoctoral research fellow at Yale University with a Fogarty Global health research fellowship to conduct research in Lusaka, Zambia. As a minority woman who has research experience in India, US, and now Zambia, Shilpa brings her unique views on women in science, science and public opinions, and what science can bring to Africa. Global Voices (GV): What drew you towards a career in science? 
After the completion of my master's degree in molecular biology, I worked on a project to identify a novel drug target for Mycobacterium tuberculosis at AstraZeneca, India. My internship at the company taught me that multidisciplinary team efforts from basic laboratory researchers to public health workers are necessary to address critical global health concerns in a sustainable manner. 
I had the opportunity to spend a year in Lusaka, Zambia from 2008-2009 and I noticed the direct and indirect impact of HIV/AIDS that cut across all strata of society. 
GV: In your opinion, what can medical research bring to countries where the needs for primary healthcare are more pressing? 
SI: Research can help build resources in less fortunate countries. This includes the introduction of technology and instrumentation, training and knowledge-building among local researchers, the generation of opportunities for employment and education (even through exchange programs). The development of research capacity can foster global partnerships and collaborations and result in the building of an organization's reputation. 
Do you think that this false perception has changed and do you think women scientists are now more recognized for their contribution? SI: I think that the position of women in science has changed for the better in recent years. However, their place in a scientific society is still far from ideal. 
Men with these same qualities are, however, revered and respected. Growing up in the developing world, I experienced women being required to toe their male supervisor's line (even though they were far more accomplished/brighter), discriminated against because they were female and subject to harassment from male professors/supervisors. 
In general, it felt like an uphill battle to be a woman scientist and these struggles had nothing to do with what should be gender neutral issues like funding and publications. In the US, I definitely felt more secure voicing my opinion, defending my research and applying for awards. 
Most importantly, we are trained to not blindly accept a hypothesis, but to do the research and if required, change our hypothesis. In this age, where people with political agendas to further seem willing to bend the facts and falsely represent data, more than ever, we owe it our training, and to the people out there, to help them understand the fallacies of 'fake news', to help them understand how to do their own research and the importance of a balanced and informed decision. We cannot ignore the facts we do not like, this is crucial for us to explain to the public. 
What should it focus on and how we can help its development? SI: I will begin by saying I am a novice global health researcher, and my limited experience only applies to Zambia and South Africa. There is tremendous potential among local researchers to conduct and develop research studies, both basic and translational. 
The involvement of the local communities and counselors (particularly in public health research) is both encouraging and critical to a project's success. Some of the areas that research should/could focus include infectious disease prevention and treatment, mental health awareness and treatment, maternal and child health and prevention of mortality, sustainable economic development and the creation of local jobs by foreign and local employers. The education and support of local mentors and scholars will help foster the development of research in Africa. 
Conducting Medical Research in Africa: Opportunities and Misconceptions &middot; Global Voices 
Ranjit Warrier in 2016 in Zambia with his permission 
Medical research conducted in Africa is often undercovered and ignored by the media, but it is a thriving field that highlights the continent's most pressing needs. 
The reason why there is demand for locally conducted medical research is two-fold: Firstly, global health currently does not have the range of medicines and vaccines required to tackle the health issues specific to the African continent. Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria have a greater detrimental impact on the poorest countries of Africa and a lack of investment in products targeting these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem. 
Secondly, research conducted by African scientists will serve to develop research capacities in Africa and an increased role for science and technology can only be beneficial to the continent's economic development. 
Dr. Ranjit Warrier is the director of the Central Laboratory at Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ). He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990's just as the AIDS epidemic began to take a major toll on the national health. He left Zambia to pursue higher education in the United States in Louisiana, then Indiana. He conducted his own research on the HIV virus as a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania before deciding to go back home in order to make an impact on Zambian healthcare. 
Global Voices discussed both the future of medical research in Zambia and the things that the media gets wrong about such research in Africa with Dr. Warrier. (Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier is speaking in a personal capacity): 
Global Voices (GV): What is your research topic? 
Ranjit Warrier RW: I'm doing a lot of implementation work currently, supporting the Zambian national ART programme with Laboratory testing. I am just starting a research programme in Molecular Diagnostics development for HIV, TB, and other pathogens of interest. 
GV: What do you see/think are the trending and hot topics in science in your country and Africa in general? 
How is it different from that in Western countries? RW: There is no basic R&amp;D. It's all implementation of solutions developed elsewhere. This has to change, otherwise we will always be receivers rather than makers. 
The received solutions are not usually ideal for our environment and making them work here correctly is sometimes impossible. GV: Where does the funding and support come from? 
Different projects have different levels of funding. It is difficult to recruit people to come back or to move here, as funding and growth opportunities are better in other countries . 
GV: How are the research infrastructures? What are the obstacles in your routine research activity that you didn’t encounter before? 
RW: Basic infrastructure is not up to developed country standards and it costs a lot to get uninterrupted power, water, and Internet. Supplies are expensive and take months to be imported from other countries. 
GV: What are the public’s opinions towards science and scientists in Africa? RW: There is interest, but an extremely limited understanding of the scientific method. 
I would suggest critical thinking and the scientific method be taught in school to improve the situation. 
GV: In your opinion, what is the potential in scientific research in Africa, where it should focus on and how we can help its development? There is amazing potential. 
There is need for dedicated science education starting at all ages. Social sciences, computer sciences, big data, outer space exploration, healthcare (non-communicable and Infectious diseases), and traditional medicine efficacy will pay off big. 
GV: Could you describe the pros and cons of the life as a scientist in Africa vs Western countries based on your experience? 
RW: Mainly it is the speed of doing things and the access to expertise that are big challenges here. The system that journals have to put articles behind paywalls is also limiting the amount of information and the speed with which research can be done.

Fire Balloon Competition in Myanmar's Taunggyi Celebrates 'Festival of Lights' &middot; Global Voices

This article by Zaw Zaw is from The Irrawaddy, an independent news website in Myanmar, and is republished by Global Voices as part of a content-sharing agreement. 
Tens of thousands of people gathered in Shan State capital Taunggyi this week to celebrate the annual balloon festival held around the full moon day of Tazaungmone, the eighth month of the Myanmar Calendar. 
The balloon festival takes place from October 26 to November 4 this year and is part of the Buddhist celebration of Tazaungdaing, or the “Festival of Lights.” 
The week marks the end of Kahtein, where robes are given to Buddhist monks. Each year, teams of locals launch homemade hot air balloons made of paper and bamboo in a competition that concludes the day after the full moon, which this year falls on Friday. 
Although the British reportedly introduced the annual balloon competition during the colonial era, the practice is also considered an offering of light to Buddhist spirits. 
During the day, balloons are launched and a fairground runs at the site of the festival—a field on the outskirts of the mountaintop town of Taunggyi. The festival is one of the most famous and significant cultural celebrations in Myanmar. 
As much as it is spectacular, it is also one of the most dangerous festivals where people are sometimes injured—and even killed—in accidents while launching the balloons. See more photos of the festival below: The balloon festival is part of the Buddhist celebration of Tazaungdaing, or the “Festival of Lights.”

"A Short History of Japanese Horror" takes a look at horror in Japanese culture, from the genre's roots in folk stories and Kabuki plays throughout the ages. 
The video covers many Japanese horror classics, including "Kaidan" and "Onibaba" from Japan's Golden Age of cinema in the 1950s and 1960s to more contemporary landmark horror films such as "Tetsuo: the Iron Man" and "Ringu".

Activist Faces Imprisonment For His Book Criticizing The Indian River Inter-Linking Project &middot; Global Voices 
India River Inter-Linking Project map. Image by AmyNorth via Wikimedia Commons. 
On 22 October, police in the southeastern Indian state of Tamil Nadu charged Indian educator, researcher, and activist T. Jayaraman for comments allegedly made in his recently published book. Police in Mayiladuthurai &#8212; a town in Tamil Nadu &#8212; offcially accused Jayaraman of speaking against national sovereignty and integration, an act punishable under the Indian Penal Code Section 153B (1)(b). Jayaraman is a professor at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai and a researcher in climate policy. 
Last July, Jayaraman was also arrested &#8212; along with eight others &#8212; for participating in protests against the Indian multinational, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, and its oil extraction in Kathiramangalam in Tamil Nadu. 
For the 42 days he was detained at the Tiruchirappalli Central Prison, Jayaraman penned the 48-page booklet at the center of the current conflict. 
The booklet titled, "Nathigalai Inaippum Aarugalai Pidungi Virkkum India" (Interlinking of Rivers and India Snatching and Selling Its Rivers), was released the same day Jayaraman was charged, and allegedly addresses concerns about the possibility that the River Inter-Linking project would lead to corporate control of public water sources. 
The Indian Rivers Inter-link is a large-scale civil engineering project that aims to connect 37 Himalayan and peninsular rivers. 
The idea is that the water-surplus rivers will be contained with dams, and the excess water will be diverted by a network of reservoirs and canals to rivers that need more water flow. 
This project is aimed at reducing persistent floods in some parts of the country and water shortages in others. However, ecologists and environmentalists have warned that the project is imprudent, dangerous and a disaster in waiting. 
...the corporate companies are funding this project, and in return, the rivers will be under their control and the farmers and public have to buy water from these corporate companies and the book deals with these problems. 
Jayaraman claimed that the charges are baseless and the book is not against national unity. He also asked: 
How is this a democracy if I am not allowed to express my thoughts? 
Are we not allowed to write against government schemes anymore? 
People reacted to the situation on Twitter: This is sad! 
Can anybody make me understand how opposing govts policies become sedition? 
In the past, the Tamil Nadu government has used sedition laws to target anti-nuclear protestors. 
In December 2011, more than 6,000 protestors from fishing villages of Idinthakarai and Kudankulam were charged under Section 121 (waging war against the government) and Section 124A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code for their protests against the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant. In 2016, sedition charges were also filed against Amnesty International India, on the grounds that certain slogans used in one of their events were insulting to India. 
Lawyer and Activist Prashant Bhushan from New Delhi writes in Facebook: 
Sedition case for writing against river linking! 
It remains to be seen whether the case against Professor Jayaraman will hold up. 
In the case of Kedarnath vs the State of Bihar (1962), the Indian Supreme court outlines the limits of a citizens right to criticize government: 
A citizen has the right to write or speak anything about the government or its measures, by way of criticism or comment so long that it does not incite people to do violence against the government established by law or with the intention of disrupting public order. 
Traveling Japan by Bus... on YouTube &middot; Global Voices 
Taking the Nagasaki Kenei bus to the Shimabara Peninsula. Photo by Nevin Thompson. 
Tamura Kenichi has pulled off an incredible achievement: he has traveled from one end of Japan to the other by local bus. 
The first video in the series begins near Wakkanai, Japan's northernmost settlement. The trip continues by bus along the remote Sea of Okhotsk coastline, passing through some of the most spectacular scenery in Japan. Not all of the 11-plus-hour trip is documented in the video, but it's still a great way to explore Japan. 
In another video, Olelesaggy travels by bus from the Japan Sea castle town of Kanazawa up the west coast of the wild and remote Noto Peninsula, a trip of about 100 kilometers. 
As the bus travels through some of the more isolated towns on the coast towards the end of the video, based on the warm and animated conversation it becomes obvious the bus driver is quite friendly with the passengers on the bus, locals who rely on the transit service to get around this rural area. 
Toxic Smog in New Delhi Leaves Residents Coughing and Demanding Action &middot; Global Voices A foggy morning in Dhaula Kuan, Delhi.

Over the last few days, India's political capital, New Delhi, has witnessed toxic smog engulf the city, threatening a break-out of major respiratory ailments. 
In response, the government has shut down schools and declared a public health emergency, but criticism is building that authorities aren't doing enough to solve the situation. 
There have been increasing instances of smog engulfing many parts of North India just before the winter in recent years. 2017, however, has seen the problem worsen dramatically. The photos below, uploaded by Twitter user @gandabherunda, illustrates how thick the smog was at the end of October. 
This is #Delhi as seen from above just few minutes before landing.Wonder how do ppl even breathe,live &amp; survive here everyday! #Smog pic.twitter.com/jQFtq8TeUR — Chetan Anantharamu (@gandabherunda) October 27, 2017 
According to the US Embassy air pollution tracker in New Delhi, the levels of PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) reached 703 on November 7, 2017, which is far above 300, the mark when air is deemed as hazardous. The World Health Organization says sustained exposure to high levels of PM 2.5 can cause respiratory diseases, inflammation of the lungs, and even heart problems. 
To compare, New Delhi's smog beats Beijing's infamous pollution, according to reports, as the carcinogenic pollutants in the city's air are ten times the reading in the Chinese capital. 
'Delhi has become a gas chamber' 
The capital's chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, took to social media, terming the megacity of 20 million people as a "gas chamber" and blamed the pandemic to crop burning in neighboring Indian states: 
Delhi has become a gas chamber. Every year this happens during this part of year. 
This augured by low wind speeds and low temperatures make the problem worse and are having a negative impact on residents' health. 
According to the UK newspaper the Guardian, doctors in New Delhi have claimed half their patients suffering from lung cancer are non-smokers. Arvind Kumar, a lung surgeon at the medical facility told the Guardian: 
In the last two years, half my lung cancer patients have been non-smokers. I am seeing a peak in people aged in their 40s, even people in their 30s. Our cancers are occurring earlier, more in non-smokers, and more in females.” 
The World Health Organization meanwhile has named Delhi the world's most polluted mega-city, beating Cairo, Mumbai, and Kolkata. And according to international medical journal, Lancet, air pollution has claimed as many as 2.5 million Indian people in 2015. 
Many citizens have taken to Twitter to express their disdain. The #SmogInDelhi hashtag was trending for a while. Journalist Annie Gowen wrote: 
Is "bad weather" some kind of euphemism for "Punjab and Haryana farmers illegally burning acres of paddy stubble and endangering millions across northern India and Lahore, Pakistan"? https://t.co/FUCBV80e7W — Annie Gowen (@anniegowen) November 10, 2017 
Journalist Aman Sharma expressed concern over the perceived lack of action to solve the problem: Feeling sick to the core due to this smoke &amp; smog though I was not out much. No one doing anything about it. 
Delhi CM trying but alone can't do much. This too, shall pass - seems everyone's solution to this! 😷 — Aman Sharma (@AmanKayamHai_ET) November 8, 2017 
Many have complained about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government's silence over the smog issue: 
So far we have seen zero sense of emergency from Central Govt when it comes to capital’s killer pollution. Emergency meetings should be called &amp; action taken on a war footing. Environment Minister @drharshvardhan should cancel his visit to Germany and come back to India soonest — Rahul Kanwal (@rahulkanwal) November 8, 2017 
Blogger Shivam Vij wrote for Quartz: 
Headlines even in the international press have been telling for years that India has the worst air quality in the world. The planet’s most polluted cities are concentrated in this country. You’d think prime minister Narendra Modi would at least want to be seen as doing something about this, if not actually doing something. He hasn’t said a word. 
Recently, the Supreme Court of India banned burning firecrackers during Diwali festivals in New Delhi because of the pollution they cause. 
Rafiul Rehman observed on Facebook: Can't believe it's been close to a month since Diwali and Delhi is still so polluted! There is smog everywhere. 
Sigh. The court's ruling was seen as a "communal" one by right-wing groups, who in response distributed firecrackers. 
One netizen called them out for their behavior: 
Any plans of distributing masks to slum kids now? #DelhiSmog https://t.co/VKMTT6AAP8 — Hasiba (@HasibaAmin) November 10, 2017 'No one is doing anything about it' 
I have been coughing for over a month, and it is only a week or so back, that I realised that it’s because of the pollution. It’s terrible. It can be brought down, but no one is doing anything about it. 
While Anuradha Sengupta urged on Facebook for people who are able to take more personal responsibility in their consumption habits: 
Don't understand this - helpless many? Give up the car (or do not buy multiple cars), stop so much consumption, shut down factories. ... but most people do not want to make changes to their lifestyle. 
The people who are lowest down the ladder, who have to live (and work) in the open on the roads - they are suffering the most. 
And of course, the creatures who are not humans - who are probably dying by the droves without being accounted for. 
For some like daily laborers and rickshaw drivers, smog is a daily problem affecting their health: 
Even rickshaw drivers wear masks in New Delhi now but this is clearly not enough to protect them against the #airpocalypse pic.twitter.com/JgSfvbPeZj — Agnès Bun 黃瑩燕 (@AgnesBun) November 8, 2017

Tuberculosis patients aren't safe in Delhi, as this journalist noted: 
And Atishi Marlena emphasized that the smog problem goes beyond New Delhi: 
For anyone who thinks that smog is just a Delhi problem, pls look at this map of North India! pic.twitter.com/M2K5KHCqGI — Atishi Marlena (@AtishiMarlena) November 8, 2017 
The Delhi government has decided to reintroduce the Odd-Even nameplate traffic rule from 8 am to 8 pm in the national capital from November 13-17. Under this rule, private vehicles are allowed to run based on the last number of their license plates. The system was first implemented in Beijing in 2008 just before the summer Olympics and was tried in 2015 and 2016 in Delhi. 
According to Shivam VJ, this may not be the answer as "the main cause of pollution is road dust and farm fires, but even within vehicular pollution, it is trucks and two-wheelers." 
Painting a New Story: Sohrai Art in Jharkhand &middot; Global Voices Examples of Sohrai Painting. 
Screenshot from the Tribal Art of Hazaribagh page via Bulu Imam 
This post was written by Alankrita Anand, and originally appeared on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization based in India. An edited version is published below as part of a partnership with Global Voices. 
Sohrai and Khovar, the traditional art forms from the Indian state of Jharkhand, are ritualistic art forms practiced by women. In recent years the art form has received a lot of attention as the state art and culture department is commissioning tribal artists and experts to paint the walls of government buildings, railway stations, and airports with colorful murals. This is instilling a sense of identity in the tribal artists and bringing their confidence back. 
Sohrai art is the art of the Sohrai (harvest) festival. 
Created from mud on the mud walls of houses in Jharkhand https://t.co/yjrR4Peu8s pic.twitter.com/88rEU7Iu6m — SADACC Trust (@SADACCTrust) October 4, 2017 Sohrai art form has been named after the namesake harvest festival that starts around Diwali. During harvest, the women of the house clean their houses and walls and paint murals of Sohrai arts. 
With her small pots of natural colors, extracted from different kinds of soils and rocks, well-known Sohrai artist Putli Devi makes deft strokes on the wall as Community Correspondent Basanti Soren talks to her about the art form. 
In the video Putli Devi mentions: 
What is special about the art form is that it is only made by women and passed on by women, and a handful of them at that. 
Most of them belong to the Kurmi community and live in Hazaribagh. 
Putli Devi grew up in Chotanagpur, Hazaribagh and watched her mother paint murals with her fingers and learned the art form too. 
I used to see wolves and wild cats run away with hens in the forest, so I started depicting them in my paintings. The paintings are done using red, black, yellow and white colors and depictions of animals abound. Devi says: 
I paint from memory, things I have seen growing up and things that I see around me. 
But Putli and her co-artists were not always recognized for their work, neither did they do it commercially. However, Putli Devi is now thrilled at having showcased her work in countries like Australia and Germany. One day, Bulu Imam came this way and really liked my paintings. 
I was reluctant to meet him but my sisters-in-law insisted. He encouraged me to paint on paper and took my paintings to a global audience 
75-year old Bulu Imam is an environmentalist working on the preservation of indigenous art and culture in Jharkhand. He explains: 
Indigenous peoples, the world over, have rights over the lands that they historically inhabit, but in India, there are limitations on these rights. 
India has voted in favor of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) but does not recognize the term ‘indigenous peoples’ itself, making the declaration inapplicable to India. 
On the ground, this translates to a violation of the rights of indigenous communities. Imam, for instance, points out that while Indian indigenous people or Adivasis are dependent on their land for their livelihood, they have no rights to the “crops under the land”. “I am talking about mining”, he says, referring to the rich mineral resources that the Chotanagpur plateau is home to. 
The question of indigenous art and culture is strongly linked to identity, and rights. 
Imam says: I found proof of Jharkhand’s adivasis’ indigeneity in their art, the caves in the region bear similar art from thousands of years ago. For indigenous communities to claim their rights, we have to establish that they have been living on the land historically. 
Basanti, who also belongs to a tribal community, feels that it is important to preserve one’s art and culture. 
The newer generation does not know much about its history, which is why it is important to promote local cultures. 
We must be aware of our traditions, it is a matter of identity. Devidas Gaonkar, a correspondent who documents indigenous cultures in Goa, feels the same way about art, culture, and identity.

More beautiful Sohrai art from Hazaribagh coming to Ranchi airport. 
Has taking the art form from the villages to global and commercial spaces brought prosperity to its practitioners? 
Basanti says that there has definitely been an improvement in Devi’s financial situation but it’s not a lot and no one takes interest in learning the craft anymore. 
Imam, however, points out that the difference that it has brought in Devi’s life is a sense of identity and confidence. “It is priceless,” says Imam. Video Volunteers runs India's only reporting network that's focused exclusively on providing broad coverage from the poorest, most media-dark districts in India.

Petition to Free the Eritrean Man Unjustly Arrested in Italy for Mistaken Identity &middot; Global Voices 
Photo via altreconomia.it. A 29-year-old man who says his name is Medhanie Tesfamariam Behre has been on trial in Palermo a year and a half for human trafficking. 
In what looks to be a case of mistaken identity, the authorities arrested him because they believed him to be Medhanie Yehdego Mered, known as "The General," the mastermind behind human trafficking in the Mediterranean over the past few years. 
The Italian authorities had been seeking Mared since the dramatic shipwreck of the Lampedusa on October 3, 2013, in which 368 people died and at least 20 remain missing. 
Behre was arrested at the Asmara Corner Café in Khartum, Sudan, by the Sudanese police on May 2016 after a long international investigation led by the Italian, English and Sudanese secret services. He was extradited to Italy on a special flight on June 7, 2016. 
In a post published on Nov. 13, he shares what was found by Lorenzo Tondo, a journalist from Palermo who has been following the case for The Guardian. 
"I have been following this situation for a year and a half, " he says" it should be the arrest of the biggest human trafficker, but as soon as we saw him in the airport we realized Mered had nothing to do with it." While the Tribunal of Palermo was hunting Mered down, he—the actual trafficker—was in jail in Dubai for faking passports. 
"He was freed in August of 2106," Tondo confirms. Berthe, instead, is still in jail and it doesn't look like he'll be out anytime soon. The trial has changed judges four times. 
According to Italian law, whenever the judge changes the trial must restart. On July 4, the site newsicilia.it revealed that the defense presented two witnesses, who now have asylum in Sweden, who say with certainty that the man arrested is not Mered. 
Fonte: eritrea-chat.com 
Today, there would be two witnesses ready to testify that Mered is not the criminal wanted for over two years, but a young man named Mered Tesfamarian. As the Guardian reports, one of the two witnesses is Ambesyer Yeman, 23, an Eritrean refugee arrived in Italy with Meted's organization in 2013. 
"I don't know the man who's been arrested. 
I saw a photo of him published on Facebook and I immediately said, 'this is not Mered,' said the young man. Further, Tondo revealed on his Facebook page that Italian prosecutors had recorded one of his conversations. 
Palermo's prosecutors have wiretapped some of my conversations with a source, a young Eritrean man who was helping me with interviews on the "Mered matter," the identity mistake of a refugee arrested by mistake because believed to be a human trafficker. 
To try to do something concrete on this story, Abdoulaye Bah, the author of this post, supported by a large group of activists, readers and specialists, is launching a petition that we ask you to sign: 
Liberate Medhanie Tesfamariam Behre, il falegname eritreo, in carcere per omonimia (Petizione su Avaaz) 
Free Medhanie Tesfamariam Behre, the Eritrean carpenter in jail for homonymy (petition on Aavaaz) 
We demand that Medhanie Tesfamariam Behre be released immediately and that Italy publicly admits its mistake, with apologies. 
The critically endangered Jamaica Iguana. 
Photo by conservation photographer Robin Moore, used with permission. 
The Jamaican government’s decision to create a wildlife sanctuary in an area once threatened by a megaport development has brought joy to the hearts of environmentalists, who campaigned for years to “Save Goat Islands.” 
While there are questions over how the sanctuary might work in practice, for the most part the proposal is being seen as an early Christmas present. The wildlife sanctuary is intended to protect the critically endangered Jamaican Iguana (Cyclura Collei), which had been thought extinct but was accidentally rediscovered in the Portland Bight Protected Area's Hellshire Hills in 1990. The animal is the subject of the Head Start program at Kingston's Hope Zoo, which rears the animals in captivity and releases them into their natural habitat once they are old enough to deal with any possible predators. 
Local campaigners &#8212; and the overseas conservation organisations that supported them &#8212; had exhaled back in September 2016, when Prime Minister Andrew Holness announced that he had decided not to proceed with plans for a proposed Chinese transshipment port. 
The Jamaica Environment Trust tweeted that Jamaican Iguanas were now celebrating in the area where they have been released into the wild: 
Overseas conservation organisations also celebrated: 
Great News in Jamaica! 
Goat Islands in the Portland Bight Protected Area (PBPA) has been established as a wildlife sanctuary for endemic and endangered species, including the critically endangered endemic Jamaican #Iguana. via @jamaicaobserver https://t.co/E3qBGJoXUX @iguanafndn pic.twitter.com/90xWUTmZyZ — Shedd Research (@SheddResearch) December 15, 2017 The Fort Worth, Texas-based International Iguana Foundation shared on Facebook: 
ITS OFFICIAL!! the Goat Islands will finally be designated a wildlife sanctuary that will include the Jamaican Iguana as its flagship species. 
This has been our 'end game' for many years but that dream almost vanished in 2013 when the area was on the verge of being handed over to Chinese interests for development. 
The IIF and our partners launched an opposition campaign that successfully fought this idea for 3 years until the Jamaican government finally bowed to public pressure. 
We want to thank our many supporters who helped fund this campaign that kept the pressure up to Save The Goat Islands and the Jamaican Iguana. 
Victories in the conservation world and few and far between these days, and this one is particularly sweet. 
From all of us at the IIF, we hope you will join us in celebrating this hard fought success. 
High-profile environmentalist Diana McCaulay had led the Goat Islands campaign with her team at the Jamaica Environment Trust (JET), advocating tirelessly against a transshipment port in the already protected wetlands and islands on Jamaica’s south coast. 
The two islands are part of the Portland Bight Protected Area (PBPA), which includes two-thirds of Jamaica’s mangroves and a large area of dry limestone forest &#8212; both vulnerable habitats that are home to many endangered and endemic species. 
The PBPA is managed by another environmental NGO, the Caribbean Coastal Area Management Foundation (C-CAM).

Photo by Emma Lewis, used with permission. The announcement would have been especially gratifying for McCaulay, who will retire at the end of 2017 as the CEO of JET, which she founded 25 years ago. 
Many Jamaicans have praised her determination and successes as an environmental activist: 
Take a bow because you fought hard for these. 
Respect due to the #GOJ for listening &amp; doing the right thing. 
Protect our #Environment #Jamaica https://t.co/q4mIzq2Z9L — Marcia Forbes (@marciaforbes) December 15, 2017 
As the first woman to speak in the series, she made a passionate plea for the Caribbean environment and stressed the existential threat of climate change to the region. 
1. No port at Goat Island ✅ 2. 
4. Largest solar farm in Caribbean✅ 5. 
Accomplishments aside, some questions are being asked about the designation of a "wildlife sanctuary" and whether the iguanas might swim from the islands to shore. 
Conservationist Wendy Lee asked: I am happy for any positive news on the environment, but aren't the Goat Islands already supposed to be protected as part of the Portland Bight Protected Area and proposed Biosphere Reserve? To which C-CAM head, Ingrid Parchment, responded: 
I am not sure under what act the Wildlife sanctuary was declared however this is what we want. 
Diana McCaulay observed: An assessment of what's on Goat Islands now will have to be done, especially of any invasive species. 
Also an assessment of the habitat - and then a decision taken about what can go there. 
So will there be a transshipment port somewhere else on the island? 
Last year, the prime minister suggested that there might be another location, but there has been no confirmation of this, so far.

Used under a Creative Commons license. In 2015, Hala Yousef, the Minister of Population in Egypt, reported that out of all marriages in Egypt, 15% are child marriages. Although the age of marriage increased to 18 in 2008, the practice continues to be a phenomenon across the country, and especially in poorer regions. 
In addition to violating the rights of children, these practices often lead to direct violence on the children, who are almost always girls. 
A 2001 study showed that 29 percent of married children have been beaten by their husbands. 
In 2014, the American University of Cairo's Social Research Center found that 27 percent of girls married before the age of 18 had been physically abused by their husbands. 
Furthermore, in a report from 2016, a UN panel concluded that the persecution of well-known women human rights defenders contributes to Egypt's ongoing poor record on women's rights: 
The continuous persecution of women human rights defenders such as Azza Soliman and Mozn Hassan... establishes and reinforces a pattern of systematic repression of the Egyptian women’s rights movement, aiming to silence and intimidate those working tirelessly for justice, human rights and equality. 
To address these issues, Global Voices spoke to Samah Mansur, an Egyptian activist who has worked on women's rights for over 10 years.

Mansur works as an officer of the gender and women's rights unit at the Appropriate Communication Techniques for Development Center (ACT). She is a member of the "Say No To Child Trafficking" Initiative, a group that works on monitoring and documenting child trafficking and child marriage in Egypt. Mansur also helped establish the "I Saw Harassment" Initiative to raise awareness and combat harassment in Egypt. 
In 2007, she was awarded a prize by the United Nations Development Fund for Women for her research on fighting violence against women. Nevena Borisova (NB): How did you start working on women's rights? 
Samah Mansur (SM): I’ve been fortunate to come from a family where volunteering is considered absolutely important. 
My parents believed that the best gift they could ever give me is to help people in need. I was allowed to spend copious amount of time at charities, and shelters to help orphans, battered women, and people in need, beyond what I was taught in school and so nurtured me into volunteer lover that I am today. 
Since 2003, I have been involved in the non-profit sector and I joined the Appropriate Communication Techniques for Development (ACT) which works on fighting all types of violence against women. 
I am lucky because I am able to choose what to do and I am absolutely passionate about everything I do. 
NB: You are a member of the 'Say No to Child Trafficking' Initiative. What is the current extent of the problem in Egypt and what are the measures that must be taken? SM: In Egypt, child marriage and child trafficking are a social phenomenon which primarily affects girls who live in extreme poverty in rural areas, and is becoming more prevalent in urban areas, as well as in Upper Egypt. Twelve percent of them are married before they turn eighteen. 
The money goes to the girl’s unemployed male siblings and father. NB: You helped establish the 'I Saw Harassment' initiative. 
And the problem is deeply rooted. For this reason I participated in establishing the I Saw Harassment Initiative which works on monitoring and documenting sexual harassment crimes against women. NB: What about women's career opportunities in the country? 
Rice Fields and Carabaos: A Glimpse of Rural Life in the Philippines &middot; Global Voices 
Listen, can you not hear the song of a new life coming from the fields and the mountains? Photo and caption by Lito Ocampo, used with permission 
Veteran photographer and activist Lito Ocampo has been making frequent visits to his hometown of Pampanga, located in the central part of Luzon Island in the Philippines, to escape the noise and dirt of the capital region Manila. 
His visits allowed him to recall his childhood while enjoying the quaint beauty of his birthplace. 
Through photos he shared with Global Voices, Ocampo captured not just typical scenes in a lowland farming village, but also, perhaps unintentionally, the state of Philippine agriculture. For example, the continuing prevalent use of carabaos reflects the backward condition of the country’s agricultural sector in general. 
The use of roads for drying crops indicates the lack of facilities available to farmers. 
Beyond highlighting idyllic countryside life, Ocampo reminds young photographers to take in the plight of rural residents, especially farmers, who are among the country’s poorest people and suffer health risks due to the backbreaking work they undertake in the fields. 
With urbanization continuing to spread, many farming villages and green habitats like the hometown of Ocampo can be instantly converted into commercial land or tourism centers. Thus, Ocampo’s photos can also be used to educate the public about problems regarding land use, the status of the land reform program and the pressing need to protect the environment.

Angolans Left Snickering After Post-Launch Glitch in Country's First Satellite &middot; Global Voices 
On 25 December, Angola’s first satellite went into orbit, and the launch was celebrated with a large screen broadcasting it live at Marginal de Luanda, one of the city's main avenues, accompanied by fireworks. 
Named Anglosat-1, the satellite is Russian-made, the fruit of a Russian-Angolan partnership started in 2009, and is intended to bring high-speed internet and radio and television transmission to various countries in Africa and parts of Europe. 
However, hours after its launch from Kazakhstan the satellite lost communications with its Earth platform and remained silent for several hours. 
Angolans treated the launch and the glitch with humor, but also took the opportunity to question the narratives of the world's media and the wisdom of spending money on a satellite when human development remains so poor in the country. 
Social media was full of comic reactions when news of the satellite's temporary malfunction broke: 
Meme makers are getting quicker and sharper in wit. “The satellite used a Movicel chip, that’s why it lost connection” ; “The satellite was found somewhere in Kwanza-Sul , it destroyed the vehicles of the soba and the administrator” 
Yesterday the Angolans launched fireworks to commemorate the launch of the first Angolan satellite. 
Today the Russian space agency lost contact with the satellite. 
“Moscow lost the signal of the Angolan satellite” now there is no porn for anybody 
Must be without a system… 
After all, the satellite is Angolan 
Some, though, criticized so much attention being given to the fault in the satellite – which finally re-established contact two days later, according to the Russian maker RSC Energia. 
So much international media suddenly interested only in the Angolan satellite’s failure… the hate and will to not see an African country stand out is so great? 
Angola has become the seventh African country, alongside Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, and Tunisia, to have a communications satellite in orbit. The Angolan government reports that it has invested 320 million US dollars in the project, which it forecasts that it will recover in two years. 
According to Minister of State Carvalho da Rocha, the telecommunications operators of Angola spend, together, between 15 and 20 million US dollars each month in renting space on other satellites for the region. 
Furthermore, the minister said that 40% of the satellite’s capacity has already been sold, to be used by national telecommunications operators, while the rest should be hired by other operators in Africa and parts of Europe. Angosat-1 should stay in orbit for 15 years. 
Exclusive images of Angosat. 
The Angolan satellite will be launched next month. Technicians are giving the finishing touches to Angosat’s preparation. 
However, some raised concerns, such as activist Pedrowski Teca: 
I ask: 
1 – What is the Russian flag doing on our satellite? 
2 – Why is the Russian flag most prominent and Angola’s in second place? 
3 – Why is the writing on the satellite in a foreign language (seemingly Russian)? 
For Raúl Danda, the satellite is not his priority as an Angolan citizen: 
If it is a reason of pride, because it is not just any country that sends its own satellite into space, this episode reminds me of the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations; a lot of show for nothing or almost nothing. Many of the stadiums that cost millions and millions of dollars (a “cost” cost and a stolen cost) remain there with grass growing for the goats to graze. 
Launching a satellite into space while on the ground there is no medicine, food, quality education, healthcare worthy of that name, basic sanitation … and other really basic things, seems to me a terrible irrationality… Another Angolan activist questioned why the government had brought religious practitioners to attend the launch ceremony: 
Those “religious leaders” who were brought to Moscow-Russia, for the launch of the satellite which has already gone missing, were there to do what? It seems that this government has not stopped its habit of spending money unnecessarily, or did they pay for their own travel? 
Screenshot of some of the photos found under the #JusticeForZainab hashtag on Instagram. 
The abduction, rape, and murder of a seven-year-old girl has people in Pakistan demanding swift justice and exemplary punishment for the perpetrator. 
Zainab Ansari was discovered in a dumpster on January 9 in Kasur district of Punjab province, four days after she was kidnapped. The post-mortem report suggests that the minor was strangled to death after being raped. 
The news triggered clashes in Kasur that left at least two people dead and several injured as police opened fire to disperse angry protesters demanding the immediate arrest of the rapist and murderer, who remains at large. 
The protests soon spread across the country, and on January 11 students, lawyers and other Pakistanis took to streets to continue putting pressure on authorities. 
Why has Zainab's case caused such widespread outrage? 
Footage of violent protests in Kasur, police firing on protesters, an emotional interview of Zainab's parents, and CCTV footage released to the public showing Zainab being led by the hand by an unknown man have all stirred emotions of Pakistanis. The picture of Zainab’s rapist &amp; killer is clearly captured. 
Can we please catch this animal and punish him publicly? Can we do something to protect our children? #JusticeForZainab#Justice4Zainab pic.twitter.com/Z7GghqvaTd — Ihtisham ul Haq (@iihtishamm) January 10, 2018 But what moved people to mobilize initially? 
Columnist and blogger Moeed Pirzada, writing on Global Village Space, a news site that promotes dialogue and understanding, characterized the reason as: 
Zainab was the 12th such case of sexual assault and murder to occur within the last year in Kasur. The district was also where an organized child pornography ring came to light in 2015; Zainab’s case was a sad reminder of the misery of those nearly 300 children, aged between 10 and 15 years, who were subjected to sexual abuse and videotaped. 
There have been 11 Zainabs in Kasur last year, we forgot about them after a brief outrage! Now, will we force Police, Govts &amp; Courts to act on the 12th Zainab or forget about this too after a few days &amp; wait for a 13th Zainab to make us angry again? 
Social media demands #JusticeforZainab 
While the story has triggered angry demonstrations in the streets, more than half a million social media users have used #JusticeForZainab. 
The hashtag was first used by activists for the opposition party Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT), but soon was picked up by ordinary people and began trending around the world after two protesters were killed by police. Activist and lawyer Jibran Nasir talked about breaking taboos on sexual abuse in Pakistan: 
"Talk about sexual abuse - Break the taboo" Students, teachers, media persons and activists all gathered today at Karachi Press Club demanding protection for children through awareness and strict implementation of laws. #JusticeForZainab #JusticeForFaizan#JusticeForAllChildren pic.twitter.com/DCRBhn7HDB — M. Jibran Nasir (@MJibranNasir) January 11, 2018 
Some people highlighted the need to educate children so that they help report offenders: #JusticeforZainab should be a nationwide crack down on sexual predators. We need to protect all our children from abuse.We need education programs,awareness campaigns,police programs, harsher penalties, help lines-THE WORKS! 
Her death should mark a turning point for our nation! — Shaniera Akram (@iamShaniera) January 11, 2018 
It isn’t enough just to catch Zainab’s killer and rapist, or the killers and rapists of other children, but to PROTECT our children. 
And that is the responsibility first of the parents, and then the state #JusticeForZainab — Amber Rahim Shamsi (@AmberRShamsi) January 10, 2018 
Others have posted photographs of themselves demanding justice for Zainab: 
@shazma.amjad #justiceforzainab🙏 #justiceforzainab🙏 #justiceforzainab🙏😢 #justice4zainab #weareallinthistogether #justiceforzainab A post shared by JUSTICE FOR ZAINAB (@justiceforzainab2018) on Jan 10, 2018 at 2:29pm PST 
Nobel Peace prize winner and activist for girls right to education, Malala Yousafzai, has joined the conversation, demanding that the government take action: 
Heartbroken to hear about Zainab - a 7 year old child abused and brutally killed in Kasur, Pakistan. 
This has to stop. 
Gov and the concerned authorities must take action. #JusticeForZainab — Malala (@Malala) January 10, 2018 
Justice for all children 
While the public's attention was intensely focused on Zainab's case, in Dijkot, a town of Punjab's Faisalabad, the body of 15-year-old boy Faizan was found in a field. He was also sexually assaulted and then killed. 
It was a stark reminder of how important protections for children are. 
Will Zainab's rape and murder prove to be the tipping point when Pakistan finally moves to protect its children? We'll have to wait and see. Barbados' Sewage 'Crisis' Causes a Flood of Problems &middot; Global Voices 
The unthinkable has happened to one of the Caribbean's most popular destinations &#8212; and it has struck at the height of tourist season. 
2018 began with a sewage leak &#8212; which the Barbados Water Authority (BWA) called a "crisis" &#8212; seeping across parts of the island's popular south coast. 
The incident has already caused a slew of problems in the country: Residents have had to move to more hospitable areas, many south coast-based businesses have closed, visitors to the island have complained about contracting gastroenteritis, and the tourist-friendly destination has endured unfavourable reviews on travel websites. 
Experts from neighbouring Trinidad and Tobago are assisting the BWA in their efforts to solve the problem; however, Patricia Inniss, head of the BWA's wastewater division, was quite clear that "every tourist, business person, householder" has to play a part in finding a solution. 
She added, "We are appealing seriously to all &#8212; not only residents but larger commercial houses, hotels, large guest houses &#8212; we are not going to identify anyone specifically at this point because we don’t know exactly who are the main contributors." 
Inniss has appealed to Barbadians who do not properly dispose of waste and offered her organisation's help in educating them. But action didn't come fast enough for some countries. 
In short order, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom put out travel advisories warning their citizens about the risks of travel to Barbados. The whole mess has been made worse by the fact that some experts saw it coming. 
In January 2017, anonymous BWA officials told Barbados Today that the country's waste system was on the verge of collapse. These same BWA officials also confirmed allegations by Mia Mottley, the country's opposition leader, that the government had turned down offers to finance the rehabilitation of faulty diffusers and the construction of a proper sewage system for the west coast. 
These plants need urgent attention." This lack of attention has turned the controversy into a political football, with Mottley promising that her government will solve the sewage crisis should it win this year's upcoming general elections and Minister of Commerce, Industry and Small Business Development Donville Inniss defending his government as the poop literally hit the fan &#8212; or at least the pavement. He also denied that the Democratic Labour Party (DLP) government knew about the problem and ignored it. 
In a post titled, A Shitty South Coast, the popular Barbados Underground blog lamented the current situation: The South Coast of Barbados has been known at home and abroad as the place to wine, dine and party by locals and tourists alike. 
Regrettably in the last year the South Coast has been making the news because of sewage overflowing onto public spaces; roadways, residential and business premises. 
The reality is that the sewage system in Barbados has been poorly maintained through the years and the hodgepodge approach of the BWA has been significantly affected by a lack of funds and pertinent expertise. 
Many of us were bemused by the decision of ministers of government Richard Sealy and John Boyce to bath in the shitty waters of the South Coast in order to convince a suspicious public that all was well. 
We await PR stunt number 2! 
While sewage continued to flow along parts of Barbados' south coast, Facebook users expressed their frustration over the government's mismanagement of the situation: 
I refuse to eat or even partake in any event on that side of the island this is a down right national shame the government of Barbados should take full responsibility for this national disaster! 
And this is the perfect example of how they have managed the affairs of Barbadians! Some netizens thought the public health threat was serious enough to be called a national security issue and many more were concerned about the impact of the leak on the country's tourism sector &#8212; a sector which makes up a large majority of Barbados' gross domestic product (GDP). Others noted that there was "still not much substance shared the public", despite the fact that they are the ones most adversely affected. Editor's Note: The original feature photo accompanying this post &#8212; apparently mislabelled by the Flickr user as a 2005 aerial shot of Barbados' south coast &#8212; showed an area situated much further away from where the sewage issue is currently being experienced. 
To avoid any confusion, we have changed the photo to reflect the position of the 2018 leak. 
Japanese Media Struggles to Translate Trump's "Shithole" &middot; Global Voices 
"Donald Trump, Turd." Graphic by Liftarn. Public domain. 
On Thursday, January 11, United States President Donald Trump generated instant controversy when he reportedly referred to Haiti, El Salvador and countries in Africa as "shithole countries." 
While many newsrooms in the English-language world debated whether or not to reprint the US president's expletive, journalists working in other languages struggled to properly translate the word "shithole". 
Japanese media was no exception. While many English speakers will immediately grasp the meaning of the term used by the President, for non-English speakers the nuances of the word "shithole" can be hard to grasp. 
The Oxford Dictionary defines the word as "an extremely dirty, shabby, or otherwise unpleasant place." 
However, some major Japanese media outlets chose to use a direct translation of the word. 
For example, both the Asahi Shimbun, a major Japanese daily newspaper, and Jiji, one of the country's main wire services, translated "shithole" as "benjo" (便所), a crude word for "lavatory" that could be translated as "shitter." But there seemed to be no consensus in the Japanese media about how to translate the President's vulgarity. 
William Mallard, Reuters's Japan bureau chief documented the various translations for "shithole" that appeared in the Japanese media, as well as the Japanese-language editions of overseas media, and his tweet, in turn, sparked a Twitter discussion among other journalists and observers: 
Shocked you left us out: WSJ「便所のような国」 
Initially thought it was 「肥溜め」too, but it sounded too "technical", a word farmers would use. Never thought I'd debate about how to translate this word as part of work... — George Nishiyama (@g_nishiyama) January 12, 2018 
FYI: 
Mainichi: "Toilet-like countries" 
Kyodo: "Crappy countries" 
Newsweek.jp: "Extremely filthy countries" 
A more precise definition was offered: 
Since the words are already being stretched , wasn't the intent to say "hopeless countries"? 
Damian Flanagan, a prominent translator of Japanese books also suggested that Botchan, one of the classics of Japanese literature, provides a useful translation for the US President's vulgar language: 
Japanese should eschew direct translation of “shithole” and turn to classics...At end of “Botchan” (1906) hero says “I left this shithole” (不浄な地を離れた) Love graceful phrase “不浄な地” (“impure place”) to make comeback. @martfack @annafifield @sharp_writing @Jonny_Strategy https://t.co/lUphSUiJCw — Damian Flanagan (@DamianFlanagan) January 12, 2018 
Disgust with Trump's racist, vulgar language 
However, others paid more attention to the intent of Trump's words, rather than how to translate them. 
Prominent Japanese documentary filmmaker Soda Kazuhiro, in a tweet that was shared hundreds of times, said that the "shithole" in question is inside Trump's brain. 
During discussions with legislators, Trump referred to Haiti and some African "shithole" countries, or night-soil pits, and that the U.S. should be encouraging immigration from countries like Norway, instead of these "shithole" countries. 
However, the only shithole here is inside Trump's head. Nothing but shitty thinking and shit from his mouth. Reaction to Trump's language was strong around the world and in the United States. 
Former Canadian governor general and current secretary general of the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie, Michaelle Jean, who was born in Haiti, called Trump remarks an "insult before humanity." 
Jamie Stelter, a popular media personality in New York City and spouse of prominent American media commentator Brian Stelter tweeted: 
“I’m not going to use Donald Trump’s word today — not because I never use bad language, but because the people of Haiti and elsewhere deserve respect.” —@patkiernan on @NY1 #MorningsOn1 — Jamie Stelter (@JamieStelter) January 12, 2018 
Author Jonathan M. Katz, who has written a book documenting the United Nations response to the 2010 earthquake that devastated Haiti, explained that Haiti's standard of living is lower than that of the U.S. as a direct result of historical American policies towards the Caribbean country: 
In order to do a victory lap around the GDP difference between, say, Norway and Haiti, you have to know nothing about the history of the world. 
That includes, especially, knowing nothing real about the history of the United States. — Jonathan M. Katz (@KatzOnEarth) January 12, 2018 
In a post shared thousands of times, one Twitter user summed up the discussion of the word "shithole" by pointing what has largely been ignored &#8212; the overt racism of Trump's remark: 
Fascinating that media outlets find it easier to print "shithole" than "racist" or "racism". — 👩🏾‍💻 (@natalieisonline) January 12, 2018 
The Pollution in Iran's Ahwaz Region Turns Deadly &middot; Global Voices 
Image: public domain from Pixabay. 
Severe sandstorms have blanketed Iran's Ahwaz region again this past week, with people choking as atmospheric dust levels reach 57 times the safety limit set by the World Health Organization. In late January the news broke that citizens were crowding hospitals across the predominantly Arab region—which is desperately poor despite being home to over 95 percent of the oil and gas resources claimed by Iran—complaining of severe shortness of breath and respiratory problems. Between January 21 and 25, three people died from severe respiratory illnesses. 
The government has suspended flights to and from regional airports and closed schools, offices and banks across the once-lush province. In 2013, the city of Ahwaz, the capital of the region, topped the World Health Organization’s list of most polluted cities in the world. 
According to the report, Ahwaz’s average Air Quality Index score was 372—the global average is around 71—or “Hazardous”. It was the only city on the list with an average value above 300. Reporting on the situation at the time, the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) wrote that “contributing factors include desertification caused by river diversion and the draining of the marshes and the oil, petrochemical, metals and sugar and paper processing plants in and around Ahwaz.” 
More than four years later, the situation in Ahwaz remains unchanged, and the group most affected are the region’s indigenous Ahwazi Arabs, who have long been discriminated against by successive Iranian governments. 
The reason for the high rates of pollution is the accelerating desertification of the region, due to the extensive drying of the rivers and marshes as a result of the massive river-damming and diversion project initiated when Hashemi Rafsanjani became president in 1989. The project has seen millions of gallons of water rerouted from the region’s rivers to other parts of Iran and has intensified the already high rates of pollution and environmental degradation in the region.The dust storms combine with the constant clouds of choking pollution released into the atmosphere by the region's petrochemical refineries and factories—none of which are subject to any environmental regulations or oversight—and also with the pollution produced by the burning of sugarcane. 
Speaking on condition of anonymity due to fears of reprisals by the Iranian regime, an Ahwazi high school student told Global Voices that, "The burning used to take place during the day, but after there were protests by local Arabs chanting 'We might be able to buy potable water, but we cannot buy clean air!' they have begun burning it at night. This morning, the school grounds were covered in several centimetres of ash from the burning. I already have severe asthma, and this is making my condition worse." 
Sugarcane in the Ahwaz region 
These efforts have brought little profit: the sugarcane project has proven economically disastrous, with imports far cheaper than local production. The greater concern, however, is the widespread pollution and environmental devastation it has wrought on a region that was once the breadbasket of the Gulf area. Across the Ahwaz region, in cities like Falahiyeh, Muhammarah and Abadan, massive plantations of palm trees whose produce was famed across the Middle East have either been deliberately destroyed or simply left to wither. 
This leaves the water downstream unusable and high in saline, which destroys the arable lands of the region’s poor Ahwazi farmers. Then there’s the burning of the sugarcane, which takes place on plantations around the Ahwazi capital and other cities in the region before the May-November harvest. 
The smoke from burning sugar cane is thick and heavy due to the dense sugar and alcohol content; instead of drifting upward it blows across the land, causing severe and sometimes fatal respiratory and skin problems among the population. 
The heavy toll on health 
At the end of January, at least three Ahwazi Arabs were reported to have died as a result of respiratory problems caused or exacerbated by the region’s severe air pollution. One of them, 43-year-old Kareem Abdul Khani from the city of Susa, who suffered from chronic asthma, was rushed to the city’s Mafi Hospital on January 21 after complaining of dizziness and difficulty breathing due to the severe pollution in the area, which greatly exceeded usual levels. He died the following day. 
The second man, 47-year-old Hamid Hamdian from Mollasani County near Ahwaz city, had been suffering from respiratory disease for some time. 
He died suddenly after being overcome by severe breathing problems. The third man, 34-year-old Ahmed Chenani from Hamidieh city, 30 kilometers west of Ahwaz, died from chronic respiratory problems on the night of January 25, after suffocating from the air pollution blanketing the area. Family members who rushed him to the Golestan Hospital in Ahwaz city, said that the lack of adequate medical facilities and the negligence of medical staff contributed to his death. Rates of cancer in the region are also rising. 
A member of the medical staff at a hospital in Ahwaz who, like other interviewees, wished to remain anonymous, said that ten years ago the hospital had 40 beds that were largely underused. 
In recent years, the hospital has become overrun with cancer patients. All this is a huge price to pay, especially for the indigenous Ahwazi Arabs, who are still denied all but the most menial jobs in sugarcane and oil—the two industries wreaking havoc on their home region‚—while ethnic Persians are brought in from other parts of Iran and offered high wages and modern, purpose-built housing in segregated settlements. Despite being natives of the wealthiest region in Iran in terms of resources, the majority of the Ahwazi people live in medieval conditions under a de facto apartheid system. 
Nina Paley's 'Seder-Masochism' Film Explores Patriarchy in the Book of Exodus Through Animated Ancient Idols &middot; Global Voices 
Screenshot from the song sequence “You Gotta Believe” by Nina Paley on Vimeo. 
Global Voices interviewed American free culture activist and filmmaker Nina Paley about her new animated film "Seder-Masochism." It is loosely based on the Book of Exodus from the Torah/Bible and exposes the veiled patriarchy in the religious text. 
Creative Commons (CC) licenses are a set of licenses that facilitate the sharing of creative works. The CC0 license is the most open of all the licenses, and allows users to use, share, and make derivatives, and use the original/derivative version for even commercial purposes without any attribution. 
On the other hand, Creative Commons Non-Derivative Non-Commercial CC-BY-ND-NC is the most restrictive of all CC licenses and is close to "All Rights Reserved". Paley is the director of the 2008 full-length animated film "Sita Sings the Blues" which she released to the public domain in 2013. The film narrated the Indian epic poem Ramayana by using the 1920s jazz songs of Annette Hanshaw. 
She added in the interview that "she identifies herself as a "born-again atheist" and explains the ways in which her recent study of the Book of Exodus has left her uncomfortable. 
Several songs and scenes from the film "Seder-Masochism" have been uploaded by Paley to the Internet including the song sequence “You Gotta Believe” which turns Minoan stone goddess idols into flash animation. It features Moses and "singing" ancient goddesses who find themselves about to be defeated by patriarchy. 
Global Voices reached out to Paley to learn more about her second film. 
The music is all "found" and used without permission . Much or all of my use is Fair use, but ultimately that can only be determined in court. 
Since I'm not a Zionist, I've been called a "self-hating Jew" too. Also, the Hindutvadis called me a "white Christian woman who hates Hindus", and sent hate emails saying "how would you like it if someone made a film about YOUR religion?!" Of course I love it when someone makes a good film about Abrahamism - Monty Python's Life of Brian is the best I can think of. 
I was (am) also frequently accused of "cultural appropriation", implying that only those of Hindu/Asian descent are qualified to work with Hindu/Asian stories. 
So it seemed that everyone, right and left, wanted me to make a film about "my" religion, Judaism! 
Source: Nina Paley/Wikimedia Commons SP: The song is hilarious! 
NP: There are already goddesses in the Flash sections of Seder-Masochism I animated a couple of years ago. 
I needed to put more "goddess" into the film, and was tediously redrawing the Flash goddesses in Moho, the software I'm using now. It occurred to me that instead of redrawing them I could use the source images they're based on, I spent a few days finding the highest resolution images I could, and a few more days manually removing the backgrounds in GIMP. Moho can do things Flash can't, such as this type of animation with raster images. Anyway, they looked cool so I'm using them in the remaining Seder-Masochism scenes. 
The goddesses in flash animation can be downloaded on Wikimedia Commons. 
As Paley is producing the film on her own, she is also working with other free culture activists like the United States-based nonprofit QuestionCopyright.org to raise funds, apart from launching a Kickstarter campaign. She is uploading segments of the film publicly on the Internet as the film is being developed.

Several conservation and environment groups have teamed up to launch a campaign to promote the protection of Myanmar’s dwindling population of elephants, known as "momos" in the Burmese language. 
The "Voices for Momos" campaign enjoins the public to reject the illegal trade of elephant parts and other wildlife animals. It also asks the government to implement more programs aimed at stopping the poaching of elephants while providing alternative livelihoods to hunters. Myanmar’s wild elephant population is estimated to be between 1,400 to 2,000. 
One elephant is reportedly killed every week, and some have warned that Myanmar’s elephants could be wiped out in two decades if the killings do not stop. 
A recent news report warned that the poaching of elephants could intensify in Myanmar because its neighbor China has ordered a crackdown on the illegal sale of wildlife animals. 
Those looking for elephant parts and other endangered animals could raise the demand for these exotic goods in Myanmar. 
It also reported that the selling of elephant parts is thriving near Yangon's pagodas and other shrines where local and foreign tourists often visit. Yangon is the country’s main urban center. The need to educate the public about protecting elephants is a major goal of the "Voices for Momos" campaign. 
One of the activities intended to generate public attention was the display of colorful papier-mâché elephant statues all over Yangon. According to local artists, the papier-mâché elephants made out of recycled newspapers were the largest in the world. 
The display proved to be a hit among children: 
Come join us at the Big British Day Out at the British ambassador’s residence! 
A petition was also initiated as part of the campaign asking the government to boost its anti-poaching drive and the public to stop buying illegal wildlife products. As of this writing, more than 2,000 have signed. 
Mobile phone users can also use Viber stickers in support of "Voices for Momos".

Raising public awareness about momos is just the initial phase of the campaign. The next challenge is engaging local authorities and hunters about the need to stop the killing of elephants.

Screencap from Black in Tokyo (YouTube video). 
A short documentary from 2017 takes a look at the lives of black residents in Tokyo. Directed by Nigerian-American artist Amarachi Nwosu, the film follows five subjects, with origins ranging from West Africa to the U.S., narrating the different cultural challenges and opportunities of living in Tokyo, Japan. 
The interviewees talk about why they have decided to live in Tokyo, and what it means to be black in Japan. 
The documentary is the first instalment of Melanin Unscripted, the first in a series of films by Nwosu aimed at "uncovering the complex identities that are not generally projected in mainstream media. 
Homages to Stephen Hawking in Latin America's Media Show How Mourning for the Scientist Transcends Borders &middot; Global Voices

News of Stephen Hawking's death, announced on 14 March 2018, caused sorrow throughout the world, and Latin America was no exception. 
Hawking, 76, was known in the scientific community for his advanced theories on the radiation emitted from black holes, as well as for his studies into the origins of the universe and the Big Bang theory. 
However, the British theoretical physicist and cosmologist had achieved fame among the public too, through his efforts to bring science to a more generalized audience and raise awareness about various, often little understood, phenomena. These include advances in artificial intelligence and the survival of the human race. Hawking also dealt with what some would regard as highly controversial subjects, such as the existence of a divine being in the context of the creation of the universe. 
The Spanish-language website Sopitas published the news like this, using an interesting wink at the possible existence of parallel universes: 
We don't know about other universes, but in this one at least, the great Stephen Hawking died yesterday. 
With this sad news, millions of internet users came out to express their admiration for such an amazing person. When we say amazing, we are not just referring to his presence and his personality, but also his work as an astrophysicist that never failed to fascinate, even those who know little or nothing about science. On another note, Raúl Morales put his reaction to Hawking's death in this way on a Spanish-language site dedicated to climbing, mountaineering and other sports: 
The British physicist and scientific figure died after over half a century outliving his prognosis for the illness he suffered from, and taking humanity forward toward the most important discovery to which we aspire: that which explains reality itself. 
If we climb to reach a summit, go caving to discover the caves, then we use science to explore the universe, which is no more than the rational systemization of this same human spirit which makes us cross a river, or go see what is on the other side of the mountain. 
This work is like that of a mountaineer, an explorer, but of different summits, summits which we don't often find on our planet or, in the case of Stephen Hawking, not even within our spacetime. 
In a piece entitled "Stephen Hawking's laboratory was the universe", which appeared on a Puerto Rican newspaper called El Nuevo Día, the complexity of Hawking's theories was described like this: 
Furthermore, on the same site they created a compilation of some of Hawking's famous phrases, including this one: If aliens ever visit us, I think the outcome would be much as when Christopher Columbus first landed in America, which didn't turn out very well for the Native Americans 
On Twitter, users reacted like this: 
Rest in peace Stephen #Hawking Mexican news presenter Carmen Aristegui remembered when Hawking played himself in American TV show "The Big Bang Theory," quoting one of the lead actresses Kaley Cuoco: 
"He made us laugh and we made him laugh. 
His life and career workings have been many a subject matter on The Big Bang Theory and we are all better for it." 
Twitter user Isma shared the following curious piece of information: 
Hawking died on 14 March: Day of Pi (π) and Einstein's birthday. Also one day off the anniversary of the discovery of Uranus. 
Hawking, science's brightest star, was recognised in his lifetime with numerous awards. Among others, the Lucasian Chair of Mathematics at Cambridge University (a position which Sir Isaac Newton had in his time) and the Presidential Medal of Freedom (awarded by Barack Obama in 2009), the highest civilian decoration awarded in the United States. The medal has also been awarded to other scientists, such as Mexican chemist Mario J. Molina, who received it in 2013. 
East African Women in the Music Industry Sing Out Against Male Domination &middot; Global Voices

Photo by Jamie Topper with permission. 
Yet gender inequality, sexism, and pay gaps persist," said Carola Kinasha, a Tanzanian-based musician and activist who recently moderated a panel discussion on women in music. "It’s not that we’re not skillful enough. 
It’s that all the decision-makers are men.” 
Kinasha opened her remarks by pointing out that in the United Kingdom, women make up only 16% of the leadership within the music business. 
While limited data is available on the status of women in music throughout Africa, “Clearly, there’s a major issue with male domination in the music industry,” she said. 
Somi, a jazz artist with roots in Uganda and Rwanda who now lives between New York City and Johannesburg, describes how pushing back against tradition has been her biggest challenge as an African woman in music: 
Being part of an immigrant family and choosing a path as an artist had its challenges. 
I had to think carefully about when and how and in which spaces we as women are supposed to use our voices. 
Saida Karoli, one of Tanzania’s most popular singers who stole the hearts of festival goers with her electrifying nighttime performance on February 10, spoke with raw truth about the myriad challenges she has faced as a woman in music in Tanzania, highlighting intersectional injustices as a poor, uneducated woman from the remote village of Rwongwe, in the Bukoba region of Tanzania around Lake Victoria. 
Karoli started drumming at the age of five, going on to write and produce five albums to critical acclaim: 
I’m from a small village and I was an orphan. I didn’t have any idea how to make it in the music industry and my manager was like my father, I believed in him wholeheartedly. 
With her manager “Muta” at the steering wheel, Karoli’s popularity grew as she traveled the region from Burundi to Rwanda to Uganda, packing venues to such an extent that four people once allegedly died of suffocation. Yet according to Karoli, her manager exploited and abused her talents, claiming copyrights on all her songs and albums: 
I was young, inexperienced in the music business, and at the end of the day, I didn’t have even 100 shillings in my pocket. 
Life has been hard. Karoli revealed that while her manager opened new doors for her, he also kept her behind closed doors for a period of seven months like a prisoner, refusing to allow her to speak with other managers or producers. 
When she finally decided to break away she went to the port city of Mwanza, where, she said: I hid from my fame. 
I couldn’t face the shame. Amour, Zanzibar’s authority on copyright issues, assured Karoli that as the author of all her music, she still does have basic rights under the Copyright and Neighboring Rights Act of Tanzania (1999), but that it depends on the actual existing signed contract and the case demands further investigation and legal representation. 
Karoli, who no longer works with a manager, said she is counting on her debut back in the spotlight at Sauti za Busara to boost sales and build a name for herself again after years in the shadows. 
Amina Omar, lead singer of Siti and the Band who lit up the festival stage on February 10 with soulful Taarab (Zanzibari soul) fusion roots, expressly thanked Karoli for speaking out on a subject so few women in the region are willing to touch &#8212; the various forms of abuse and harassment women face not just in music but within society as a whole. 
Omar remembers singing at 11 years old with her sister Rahama, now an award-winning violinist in her band. But neighbors and family members frowned on the girls’ musical inclinations and eventually, her family encouraged her to marry and have children as is the tradition within Zanzibar, an archipelago where most families follow conservative Islamic customs: 
So, I got married. I had my first child. My husband told me he’d support me as a musician, but when our child was grown enough to let me go back to singing, he simply said no. ‘No,' he said. 
When Omar decided to enter as a contestant in “Bongo Star Search,” an interactive musical reality television show based in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, it sparked a violent argument with her husband. “You know, I never really talk about this but to this day, I still can’t see very well from one eye, and it’s from that night,” Amina revealed, pointing to her right eye. She struggled to leave her husband in Dar es Salaam and rebuild a life for her and her son back home in Zanzibar: 
I don’t like the position of women. I also don’t like that when my society sees me succeed, some want to keep me down. When I came back to Zanzibar, I joined the Dhow Countries Music Academy and got my education, and now I know who I am. I really love singing, it’s my life and it’s in my blood. 
Women in music often seek out role models to guide them on the path, but according to Somi: 
e have so few role models as African women in music, that we’re basically here to carve out new paths, to be the models for future generations. We’re tasked with telling our truth(s) as African women, and there’s not that many of us &#8212; it’s a short list. 
At February 10’s show, Omar channeled the spirit of Siti Binti Saad when she introduced her song with a powerful message directed mainly at men: 
This next song is my story. And I say, a woman is your wife, is your mother, is your sister. Why beat your woman? 
She should be respected. 
She needs respect! The crowd cheered.

Until a few decades ago, weddings used to be arranged inside the premises of the home or the neighborhood and was served by family and friends. 
Novelist and journalist Iraj Ahmed reminisces about his childhood: 
There was a huge gate wrapped in red, white and green clothes standing where the lane started (welcoming the guests). 
You could see people running errands like busy bees. And some were seen coming out of that scene after filling their stomachs with curry marks on their festive clothes. 
They would inadvertently walk ahead to buy a Seven Up (drink) or a paan at the local store. 
The air would be filled with joy. This was the scene of a typical wedding in Dhaka many years ago. In those days, people would say that it's bad manners to serve guests catered food; however, now people seem to be catching up with the reality of the times. 
Siddhratha Mukhopaddhay from West Bengal, India writes about the changes in Bengali weddings: 
Now the hosts want to be sure about the hospitality by giving all the responsibility to the caterers. 
The tendency to serve the guests personally has changed. 
Earlier the guests would not come to the weddings if they were not invited in person by visiting their homes. Now, it's sometimes via phone calls and people are even accepting wedding invitations via Facebook or Whatsapp! A glimpse inside the new Bangladeshi wedding menu 
Along with the changes in wedding culture, there has been a shift in the wedding food items in Bangladeshi cuisine.

Biryani 
Serving Biryani, a South Asian mixed rice dish, is now becoming a norm. Spices, fragrance rice, meat (chicken, mutton, beef, or fish), Ghee (clarified butter) and other condiments are layered and cooked together to make Biryani. Unlike Pulau (which is eaten with roast and curry dishes), Biryani is a complete dish with meat and spices (and vegetables) inside.

This post by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine that highlights international environmental solutions in action, and is republished here as part of a content-sharing agreement. 
Plastic pollution is one of the greatest challenges facing the world. Just last week, scientists writing in the journal Scientific Reports announced that the weight of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch was four to 16 times more than we thought. 
All of this means finding ways to recycle and reuse plastic waste are more important than ever. 
After seeing plastic waste was a growing problem throughout the country, he devised a method for converting recycled, shredded plastic waste into flexible, long-lasting roadways: 
When I started the work, some of the companies in the United States they came to know that, they were offering a lot of money. 
They wanted the technology to be given to them, but I said no, we are not giving like that. 
I'm giving to my country freely. To date, thousands of kilometers of highways in India have been paved using the process he invented, thereby reducing the amount of plastic waste that might otherwise be released into the environment: India's got 41 lakhs (4.1 million) kilometers, only 1 lakh is laid. 
The other roads should be laid. That is the motivation for the whole work. Budapest, Hungary-based filmmaker Seth Coleman produced, shot and edited this video. 
Photos of Japanese Soldiers in the Trenches During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 &middot; Global Voices 
The colorized stereographs provide a fascinating glimpse into a war that in many ways was a precursor to the events of the 20th century, including trench warfare that resulted in massive numbers of casualties thanks to the incorporation of advanced technologies on the battlefield. 
The stereographs were captured by American photographer T.W. Ingersoll, who in 1904 traveled to Port Arthur (now Lyushunkou, a district of Dalian in northeastern China), the scene of a long and bloody battle during the Russo-Japanese war. 
Ingersoll, who is mostly remembered today for his stereographic scenes of the United States at the turn of the last century, managed to document daily life behind Japanese lines in a series of about one hundred images. 
The stereographs, while appearing to be mostly staged, document the challenging conditions faced by soldiers forced to deal with trench warfare, including finding and protecting sources of clean water, getting enough to eat or being cared for after being injured. 
Ingersoll's images have now entered the public domain, with no known copyright, and are hosted online by various institutions, including Boston Public Library, Monash University and the Skillman Library at Lafayette College. The Lafayette collection is particularly interesting because images are accompanied by explanatory captions that appear to have been written by Ingersoll himself.

Many of the Russian government buildings and store houses were used for hospital purposes, to make room for the thousands upon thousands of wounded who kept pouring in. 
The hospitals were so full at times that new arrivals had to be deposited in the street, where they staid until a place could be provided for them.

The enormous coast defense guns which the Japanese brought over from Japan to use against Port Arthur were christened "Osaka Babies" by the war correspondents. These guns were designed to defend the coast of Japan against a naval attack, and were not expected ever to be moved from the foundations on which they rested.

The Japanese have a wonderful way of acquiring Western ways. They investigate everything, and whatever they think will improve their way of living or working they readily accept. They even had a commission examine the advantages of Christianity over their own religions, but the commission reported that the Japanese were much gentler and more honest and moral people than any Christian nation as a whole, and that the Christian zealots and hypocrites had no counterpart in Japan. 
Our picture shows Japanese private soldiers dancing a quadrille under the instruction of an American war correspondent. 
The Osaka band is playing and these soldiers are practicing with an earnestness as if all Japan had their eyes on them. Their pastimes were all innocent sports with nothing rough about them, games like fox and geese, and occasionally the low singing of an endless victory-hymn by General Fukishima, who fought under Marshal Oyama.

An orchid that blooms around mid-April in a garden of historical and cultural significance in Siraha, eastern Nepal attracts hordes of pilgrims from both India and Nepal every year. 
The locals in the area of the garden, known as the Salahesh Fulbari, believe that the flower blooms on the very first day of the year, 1st of Baishakh (the first month in the Nepali Calendar). According to legend, the orchid symbolizes the garland offered to the folk hero Salahesh by his beloved malin (a Maithili word for a female gardener). 
Strange flower!

Fascinating folklores, cultural demigod 
Not much has been written about Salahesh, also known as Sailesh (the king of mountains) and Jayavardhan. However, in the southern plains of eastern Nepal and adjoining states in Bihar of India, there are many folklore stories featuring Salahesh and his adventures. 
Different versions of folktales handed down from one generation to the other talk about Salahesh’s bravery and his love for his malin. According to one legend, Salahesh used to visit the Salahesh Fulbari to pick flowers for use in religious rituals after performing his ablutions. 
He would meet four sisters who were gardeners there, and in due course, he fell in love with one of them. The orchid which blooms in mid-April every year, according to locals, symbolizes that love. 
Young couples visit the garden on the Nepali New Year’s Day to receive blessings for their love and express hope that their love would last long just like that of Salahesh and his gardener love. 
He is also claimed, however, by the Danuwar community. 
With time, he has evolved for several communities from a Dalit hero into a demigod. 
While hundreds of thousands of pilgrims flock to the Salahesh Fulbari each year to get a glimpse of the famous flower and worship Salahesh and malin, science says something else. 
Although the locals claim that the flower blooms in the early morning on the 1st of Baishakh and wilts in the evening, the orchid blooms appear before the onset of the New Year. 
This picture of the orchid was clicked four days ahead of the 1st Baishakh, the first day of the New Year. 
The Nepali government’s Department of Plant Resources have identified the flower as the orchid Dendrobium aphyllum (Roxb.) C.E.C. Fisch, and the famed tree on which the flowers bloom as Bischofia javanica Blume or bishopwood, locally known as haram. 
Bulgarian environmental activists score important court victory in struggle to #SavePirin National Park &middot; Global Voices

Environmental activists cheered when on April 26 the Bulgarian Supreme Administrative Court ruled that the government must stop its plans to allow new construction at Pirin National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, without conducting a Strategic Environmental Assessment first. 
A coalition called For the Nature had brought the lawsuit and hailed the court's decision as an important step in their fight to protect the treasured piece of nature. 
According to WWF-Bulgaria, a coalition member: 
The plan permits construction on an area that is 12.5-times larger than currently permitted area and could lead to commercial logging affecting nearly 60 per cent of the park (currently no commercial logging is permitted in the park). 
Development of the plan has been financed by the EU. The threat to Pirin National Park has incited a five-month-long wave of protests across Bulgaria and abroad. The latest round took place in Sofia, Blagoevgrad, Plovdiv, Sliven and London on April 26, in which participants also demanded protection of natural heritage in the Black Sea area. 
The activists who initiated the lawsuit say such development will jeopardize the whole park and is in direct violation of EU Directive 2001/42/EO, which requires that an environmental assessment must be made in cases of decisions affecting tourism, forest industry and biodiversity. 
The court argued that without conducting the required environmental assessment, "the Ministry had no basis to make a proper estimate whether the actions from the plan would have an impact on the environment or not." 
The three-judge panel noted that such assessment must be based on the criteria of the Environmental Assessment Regulation, which had not been the case so far. 
Even though they briefly celebrated the Supreme Administrative Court ruling, Bulgarian environmental activists are cautious to consider it an end to their struggle to #SavePirin, as they are aware that powerful financial interests would like to claim the land for their tourism projects. 
For one, legally the ministry has two weeks to submit an appeal, which would be submitted to a five-judge panel.

Nepal’s Kami Rita climbs Mount Everest for a record 22nd time &middot; Global Voices 
Kami Rita Sherpa, 48, has climbed Mount Everest the most number of times by any human in the world. Image used with permission. 
Sherpa mountain guide Kami Rita Sherpa summited Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth, for the 22nd time, leaving behind Apa Sherpa and Furba Tashi Sherpa who have done it 21 times each. This is a world record. 
Veteran guide Kami Rita started his summit push with nine other Chinese climbers on the night of Tuesday, May 15, 2018 and reached the summit by Wednesday morning, May 16. 
Everest Tour company Seven Summit Treks, where he works as a Sherpa guide, announced his new world record: 
This morning 8:30 AM Kami Rita Sherpa made 22 successful ascents of Mt. Everest as a part of Seven Summit Treks Everest Expedition! 
Congratulations to Kami Rita Sherpa! 8:30AM on 16th May 2018(Nepal time), Kami Rita summited the highest peak Everest (8,848m) for 22 times and broke the world record titled “Most ascents of Everest - Male.” 
Sherpa is the name of a Tibetan ethnic group who are native to the most mountainous regions of Nepal and who are highly skilled and experienced climbers. However, the term has come to be used by non-Nepali people to generally refer to guides or porters working in the Mount Everest area. The job of a Sherpa guide includes preparing the route for climbers to follow, fix ropes in place, and carry the necessary climbing kit up the mountain. 
He worked for a long time as a professional guide for mountaineers for Alpine Ascents International, a Seattle-based commercial guiding company. Recently he joined Seven Summits Treks, one of a dozen Nepalese-run companies that regularly operate on Everest. He has climbed most of the peaks above 8,000 meters in the Himalaya range, including K2, Cho-oyu, Lhoste and Annapurna, among others. 
&#34;Summiting Everest? It's just like another daily chore,&#34; says Kami Rita Sherpa, 21 times Everest summiteer. &#34;These days we've technology and weather forecasting service which has made climbing Everest much easier.&#34; These days only those die who don't listen to their Sherpa guides. Otherwise, if you have will power and commitment, you too can do it! And Kami Rita is going to do it for the 22nd time. 
All the best Kami Rita, you're a legend! &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;- #everestsummit #everestsummiteer #kamiritasherpa #guinnessbookofrecords #willpower #courage #youcandoit #nepal #worldrecord #inspiration #meetingthelegend #instablogger #travelblogger #traveldiary #instalike #instapic #picoftheday 
The other prominent climbers of 2018 till now are Australian Steve Plain who completed the seven summits in a record 117 days and Chinese double amputee Xia Boyu. However, Kami Rita doesn’t want his children to follow his path as a Sherpa guide, mainly because of the tragedies on the mountain in recent years. 
Many of the deceased in the 2014 and 2015 Mount Everest avalanches were local guides and porters, including Sherpas. 
More than 4,000 people have summited Everest more than 7,000 times. And every year, the majestic mountain lures hundreds of aspirants challenging them to test their limits. Springtime in Japan means the return of the country's beloved swallows &middot; Global Voices 
Swallows in Umeda Station, Osaka.

Each spring Japan welcomes the return of cherry blossoms, rice shoots, hay fever and &#8212; barn swallows. Barn swallows are a welcome visitor in train stations, schools, shopping arcades or anywhere else they can build a nest. 
To mark the start of spring, Fundo, a Japanese website that curates Internet memes, has collected a variety of tweets welcoming swallows back to Japan in April each year. 
Sign: Welcome back, swallows! Tweet: We wanted to the swallows to build a nest, and when we installed this nest and created this poster, sure enough, they decided to nest! 
The swallows are nesting right near the entrance to our store, so when you stop by, be sure to keep an eye out for them! Barn swallows (Hirundo rustica, known as 'tsubame' in Japanese) are migratory birds that winter in the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and other countries before returning to Japan each April to nest. 
I'm at Tobu Tojo Shinrinkōen Station right now. Once again, the swallows are working all out to build their nests this year.🐦 
(Tama City News) A platform has been installed below a swallow's nest to catch dropping (at Keio Wakabadai Station). 
Image: "A message from the swallows at Kori Station, Okutama."

While our droppings may be annoyance, we hope you will watch over us until we return back to our home islands in the south." 
The birds are friendly and often show little fear of their human hosts: 
Hey, swallows! There are humans here! Why aren't you running away, lol? You're too used to us humans! 💦💦 
The swallows' time among humans is short. 
By late May, the fledglings will have mostly left the nest: I can no longer hear the chirping of the swallows. 
For many Japanese people, the return of the swallows each spring is something to look forward to, and an experience to treasure. 
These birds bring with them great happiness. I want to take great care of them 
Interview with Rosaly Lopes, a Brazilian NASA astronomer and the first woman to edit the journal founded by Carl Sagan &middot; Global Voices 
Dr. Rosaly Lopes | Foto: Divulgação, used with permission. 
Rosaly Lopes grew up in a middle-class family in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil watching Star Trek, fascinated by her school’s telescope and following all the news about the Apollo mission. 
When Apollo 13 had to return to Earth in April 1970, it was the story of Francis Northcutt, the woman responsible for calculating the spaceship's route home, that grabbed her attention. 
“Just showing a woman, in Houston’s control centre, was a very great inspiration for me,” Lopes said in a telephone interview with Global Voices (GV). 
Forty-eight years after the mission, Rosaly Lopes has become one of the world’s most important scientists. 
Created by the famous astronomer Carl Sagan, the journal is a reference point in planetary sciences. She spoke with GV about her projects and the power of seeing women in important roles in science to help future generations. GV: How did you become the first woman to edit the journal Icarus? 
The editors all came from Cornell University because at the time the submissions were all sent there and passed from one professor to another. There were few editors, I think three or four. 
The last one stayed for more than 10 years. He and the American Astronomical Society, which has a division for Planetary Sciences, started to ask who would like to be a candidate. I presented myself as a candidate and they chose me. 
GV: What do you think of the ideas that question scientific data, facts, and research? RL: It is a small part of the population which think this. 
This is because there are a lot of people who are afraid that our mode of life has to change. I am optimistic, I think that we will discover ways of using energy that do not cause global warming. The problem is that the question has become more political than scientific. Rosaly Lopes doing research in Vanuatu in the Pacific.

GV: In 2005, you received the Carl Sagan medal for your work on inclusiveness in public education, especially for Hispanic youths and women. Could you speak more about your view on this? 
RL: Inclusion is important because science needs talent, it needs dedicated people, and it does not matter it they are men or women, of different ethnicities, or anything. It is important to have youths aimed at a career in sciences and technology because it is our future. 
Do you agree? RL: I think that this is a little bit of a myth. I think that 50 or 30 years ago, yes. 
Now seeing a woman scientist is not a thing that people consider 'different'. From the moment that you have 25 percent women in a scientific area, it starts to be something more normal. GV: Did you ever encounter prejudice? 
GV: How did you start taking an interest in this area? RL: I grew up with the Apollo programme and it was that which inspired me a lot. 
I wanted to be an astronaut, at first, but I saw that I was a woman, Brazilian, and very short-sighted. So, really, it was not going to happen. 
I decided this very early and never strayed from this path. GV: What did your parents think? 
RL: Fortunately, they supported me a lot, because without this I could not have taken on anything. My mother was worried that I, as an astronomer, would not have a job. But she made a point of me learning English and French, for me to have a way of earning money, even if the profession did not give me money. 
They encouraged me a lot such that I studied abroad, they paid for everything, made sacrifices, because they saw that, especially at that time, there was no field of astronomy in Brazil. Now it is better. GV: Is it common to see people from developing countries in this field? 
RL: It is not very common, but it is changing. 
When I started, really, it was not at all common. But now I am seeing more and more people. There are opportunities, especially if you are very dedicated and study a lot. We need talents working in those areas, so it is important to encourage all the people who really like the field. 
GV: A Brazilian magazine referred to you as 'the Brazilian who succeeded at NASA'. What do you think of that title? 
My preparation in Brazil was lower than the British students, although I had attended good schools. Afterwards, I was in Britain with a good job with the government, I worked at Greenwich Observatory, but decided that it was not what I wanted to do, because there was no chance of doing research. I took a risk, left the job and went to the USA to participate in JPL with NASA, with a scholarship for two years’ duration. Fortunately, it worked out, but it was a risk, because I knew what I wanted. 
My father said that the most important thing life was to have a passion, go after it and don’t give up. GV: You participated in the Cassini Mission and became one of the world’s leading specialists in active volcanoes. 
I think that my work on the Galileo Mission, on the volcanic moons of Jupiter, was what most stands out even today. But, I hope that my most important work, I have not done it yet. That I still have time ahead.

GV: What is your next project? 
RL: I just received funding from NASA, a large project of mine was approved to study the moon Titan in more depth, which is a moon of Saturn. We want to do this study with a lot of researchers, spread over all the United States, in Hawaii, Chicago, Britain. We are conducting a study on the possibility of life developing on Titan. 
GV: Do you think that we are close to the day when we can live outside of Earth? 
RL: This is what we are going to study, not only the biological aspect, which already has a team of biologists in Chicago researching if life could develop in the ocean of liquid water underneath a layer of ice on Titan, but if organic material, which could serve as food for that life, that we know exists in the atmosphere and on the surface, could penetrate the ocean and after, with cryovolcnanism, ice-volcanic activity, if it could come to the surface and we could detect those signs of life. 
GV: But do you think that we are close to the day when we could live in those environments? 
RL: I knew Carl Sagan personally, because when I worked on the Galileo Mission, he was also working on it. He did very important things, not only for the field of sciences, but for having been the first scientist who stood out for publicizing sciences in a big way. 
At the time that he started doing this, with TV programmes and everything else, the majority of scientists thought that it was not a good thing. 'A scientist should not waste time doing those things'. 
I always did a lot of publicizing, because I think it is very important to inspire the next generation. He helped me to do this, I won the medal (with his name) for exactly this. There are still people who have prejudices, but it is reducing. 
GV: Cosmos is still a reference for a lot of people. RL: It is. 
Her nickname was Poppy. She worked for a company for an airspace company, calculating orbits for spaceships and she had been helping the calculations for Apollo 13 to return. Just showing a woman, in the Houston control centre, was a very big inspiration for me. 
It is important for women scientists to raise awareness to inspire today’s girls. Swiss brewery sparks protests in Nepal for naming new beer with timur flavor after late king &middot; Global Voices

Swiss brewery Turbinenbräu created a furor among Nepalis when it used the name and image of Nepal’s former king for its seasonal beer product. 
After adding Nepali spice timur in brewing a new beer flavor, Turbinenbräu decided to call it Birendra in reference to Nepal’s king from 1972 to 2001. It also tweaked the king’s image so that it appeared he was smiling while holding a glass of beer. This infuriated many Nepalis especially those who were supporters of the monarchy. 
King Birendra, regarded as a liberal monarch, was massacred along with other family members at a royal dinner in 2001. 
Because the #beer included a Nepalese spice, the Turbinenbräu brewery in Zurich decided to name one of its seasonal beers after King Birendra, who reigned over #Nepal from 1972 to 2001 - and whose name the brewery thought sounds like beer. 
Beer is King 😃 pic.twitter.com/xCVc4vwm4t &mdash; dhirajkarki (@dhirajkarki) April 28, 2018 A few royalist groups staged protests in front of the Embassy of Switzerland in Nepal for ‘insulting’ the legacy of the late king. There was also an online petition against the so-called Birendra Beer. 
The brewery was reportedly contacted by the Swiss ambassador to Nepal who requested it to take down all online advertisements for the beer. The company subsequently decided to discontinue its promotion of the beer that used Nepali spice timur. 
Not. Birendra had gout, so wouldn't have enjoyed the dubious honour of being featured as flavour of the month by a bunch of obtuse Swiss hipsters! https://t.co/2AIaP9EgbV &mdash; rabithapa (@rabithapa) April 26, 2018 
However, not all Nepalis were offended by the beer with the timur flavor. 
People love Late King Birendra. 
People love Beer,too! 
So How and why does naming a beer “Birendra” offend people and hurt their sentiments?🤔 
I got no opinion on this one, just curious! &mdash; Maanchhe (@novemberbridges) April 21, 2018 
The founder and owner of the brewery, Adrien Weber, clarified that it was not the intention of his company to defame the name and honor of the king. 
In an email to Global Voices dated 15 May 2018, he said that the beer product is still on sale but it’s only available for springtime. 
The Birendra Beer is still on sale. But it was only meant to be a seasonal beer for Springtime. Although we have undoubtedly great success also among our Nepalese customer in Zurich, we are looking forward to the next seasonal beer, the summer special. This beer called «Taifun» is spiced with Ginger and cooked with rice. 
It will be saleable by the end of this week. The controversy is unfortunate since it could have been an opportunity to endorse the use of timur or more popularly known as Nepali pepper. 
Timur, a spice belonging to the genus Zanthoxylum, is collected from the wild and used as condiments, spice and medicine. Eight species of Zanthoxylum are abundant in 30 districts of Nepal. 
Zanthoxylum oil is consumed in several European countries. The use of timur as a cooking ingredient is also getting more attention in countries like the United States. Developing a new beer flavor by adding timur was certainly an innovative brew but too bad this was overlooked because of the naming and image controversy.

But I didn’t understand why none of the superheroes looked like me or had stories to which people like me could relate. Maybe that’s why I decided to become a cartoonist? 
All my childhood feelings came to the surface yesterday on Twitter when I stumbled on the viral video of a man selflessly scaling a four-storey building in less than 20 seconds to save a child, hashtagged #ParisSpiderman. 
Refreshing my Twitter feed gave me bits and pieces of the secret identity of the mysterious #ParisSpiderman, then they flooded my Twitter feed. His name is Mamoudou Gassama and, an undocumented immigrant from Mali. “This is a much better—and more realistic—plot than Black Panther,” I thought to myself. 
While refreshing the hashtag to try to get at this new hero’s origin story, it struck me that his religion was not mentioned, as this is usually the first adjective featured in clickbait headlines and hashtags when an immigrant does something negative. 
Within hours, the headlines were reporting that #ParisSpiderman had been invited to meet the French president and that he would be granted citizenship. A typical zero to hero intro to a superhero story. With very little light shed on the details of the backstory, it highlighted the stereotypes (black, struggling, poor, ghetto-dwelling), with a quick fast-forward to the climactic scene where the unknown underdog hero saves the child in a public spectacle— and POW!—the introduction of a new “minority” hero, a new addition to the mostly-white superhero line up. 
Here’s the missing backstory: Gassama left Mali as a teenager and traveled via , Libya—where he was arrested and beaten—to the coast, where he undertook a perilous boat journey to Italy. He spent four years in Italy before arriving in France in September 2017 to join his brother. 
He shared a cramped room with six others and was, of course, unable to work legally. So scaling that building was probably one of the easiest things Mamoudou had done in years. 
What readers should realize and what the storytellers need to do differently this time is to shed more light on the details of our hero’s life and the real hardships he’d had to endure before he scaled that building to save the child. 
Superman, the greatest of superheroes, was an immigrant but he was the “good kind”, the kind that looks “normal” and fits it, and doesn’t get randomly checked or surveilled. 
Let the introduction of this new and different superhero make France, and the rest of the world, realize how many superheroes have come in on those boats that are still waiting for their intro scene. Next issue: Is our hero going to cope with his five minutes of fame? How is he going manage now that his powers have been discovered? 
Amid setbacks by the Temer administration, thousands of indigenous peoples march into Brazil's capital &middot; Global Voices 
From April 23 to 27, more than three thousand indigenous leaders from all regions of Brazil gathered in the country's capital. Photo: 350.org, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 
This story was reported by Nathália Clark of 350.org, an organization building a global grassroot climate movement, and it is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices. 350.org participated in the National Indigenous Mobilization in Brazil as a supporter. 
The camp smelled like smoke and urucum, a plant used for body painting. A defiant energy pulsed through the crowd. We could hear chants, ritual mantras, and ceremonial crying. 
The place resounded with the voices of the more than 3,000 indigenous people from more than 100 different groups from all over Brazil, who gathered for the five-day 2018 National Indigenous Mobilization, held from April 23 to 27 in Brasilia, the Brazilian capital city. 
Also known as the 'Free Land Camp' ('Acampamento Terra Livre', in Portuguese), the sit-in is a yearly event organized by the Articulation of the Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB, in the Portuguese acronym). This year's was its 15th edition. 
According to the last Brazilian demographic census, there are 305 indigenous populations in Brazil, speaking 274 different languages. Together, they number almost 897,000 &#8212; approximately 0.47% of the country's 200-million-strong population. 
Most of them are scattered over thousands of villages, from north to south of the national territory, located in the 715 Indigenous Lands already regularized and formally recognized by the federal government. 
The 'Genocide Opinion' and other blows 
The movement has been facing a series of political setbacks, which gave renewed thrust to this year's mobilization. 
The Brazilian National Congress, whose majority is currently dominated by supporters of the agribusiness sector, are trying to approve a bill package that would undermine the rights of indigenous peoples guaranteed by Brazil's 1988 Constitution and other international laws, such as Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization. In the current complex political situation in Brazil, under the controversial administration of president Michel Temer, representatives of the agribusiness sector have gained even greater foothold and managed to also occupy other levels of government. 
Only days before the Free Land Camp took place, President Temer yielded to pressure from a ruralist caucus and fired the president of the National Indigenous Foundation (FUNAI), replacing him with someone more agro-friendly. 
Kretã Kaingang, an indigenous leader from the state of Paraná and coordinator of the indigenous program of 350.org in Brazil, recalled the kind of threats he has faced. "I was imprisoned for a time, accused of crimes that were not proven and I have been prevented by a judge from approaching the land where I was born. 
For four years I couldn’t step on the place where my umbilical cord is buried," he said. 
In September 2017, Brazil's attorney general issued a legal opinion asserting that only indigenous peoples who were occupying their territory on the day the 1988 Constitution was promulgated should benefit from the recognition of their right to land. 
Known as the "time limit" thesis, and sometimes called the "genocide opinion", it has been endorsed by President Michel Temer. 
Should it ever become law, it would severely cripple the recognition of new indigenous lands. 
'We have only one objective here: to resume the process of demarcation of our lands' 
At one point, the crowd raised candles and stopped their activities to listen to a lament sung by one of the indigenous women. It was a mourning ceremony. 
On the following day, the Esplanade of Ministries, the main route where all federal government buildings are located, was occupied again by protesters, who marched towards the seat of the National Congress. 
With paintings and adornments, dancing and singing war cries, indigenous Kaingang, Guarani, Guarani-Kaiowá, Guarani-Mbya, Xucuru, Pataxó, Munduruku, Awá-Guajá, Guajajara, Marubo, Xerente, Xavante, Kayapó, Tenetehara, Tembé, Tucano, Krahô, Kanela and many others demanded the process of demarcation of their lands be resumed and asked for respect for their rights, as enshrined in the 1988 Constitution. 
Indigenous leaders carried banners with messages targeted at the authorities: "Demarcation Now!", "No fracking in our lands!" and "Guarani resists". Other signs called out the destruction of territories, rivers and natural resources by giant infrastructure and energy projects. 
"We have only one objective here: to resume the process of demarcation of our lands. Many of our relatives could not join us, so we came to represent our communities," said Kretã Kaingang. 
During the demonstration, the street was stained red, symbolizing the blood shed by indigenous people during acts of repression and violence which are considered by many a continuation of the historical genocide perpetrated against them during colonial times. 
"'The trail of 'blood' we leave represents the violence and attacks imposed by the state to the original peoples of this country. Several invasions, threats, and assassinations have been occurring in Brazil, in addition to a cruel process of criminalization of our leaders. But despite this problematic conjuncture, we will always resist and fight, as we learned from our ancestral warriors," said Chief Marcos Xukuru of Pernambuco. 
Joênia Wapichana, the first indigenous woman and indigenous lawyer to stand up in the Federal Supreme Court, recalled what is really at play: "The fact that the Executive Branch has an instrument to restrict the right to demarcation puts the lives of all indigenous peoples at risk, whose subsistence depends directly on the land and everything it gives." "The demarcation of our lands equals their preservation. 
What we want is to ensure the lives of future generations. We fight here not only for us indigenous peoples but for the Brazilian society as a whole," said Tupã Guarani Mbya, from the Indigenous Land Tenondé Porã, in São Paulo. For the chief Juarez Munduruku, indigenous peoples are like trees. "There's life in the trees just as there is in us. 
If you kill them, they die and never come back. If a logger kills a 'cacique', a story ends." 
He recalled that in the middle of the Tapajós River, in the Amazon, where his territory is located, there are plans to build 43 big hydroelectric plants, which will dam one of the largest rivers in the country, a sacred place for his people. Two of these projects have already been implemented, and there are plans to also build 30 ports to transfer monoculture soybeans, in addition to mining and illegal logging. 
The Nepali “sausage vine” evergreen plant is famous in the United Kingdom, yet remains unknown in Nepal &middot; Global Voices 
Holboellia latifolia known as the "sausage vine" plant. Image by Flickr user peganum. (CC BY-SA 2.0) 
The sausage vine plant, a huge hit among gardeners in the United Kingdom (U.K.), originates from the jungles of Nepal, yet it remains in relative obscurity there due to lack of awareness and proper promotion. 
Nepali and Indian botanists are now trying to shed some light on the aromatic but long-forgotten sausage vine through research and advocacy. Nepal boasts botanical records of 6,000 species of flowering plants (about four times as many as the U.K.), and botanical experts anticipate that the number will reach 6,600 species when more remote regions are fully explored. 
Nepal possesses 2.8 percent of the total number of global plant species and its share of flowering plant species is also nearly 2.8 percent of the global total. 
Called "Gufala" in Nepal, the sausage vine is native to the Himalayas and its name derives from its reddish-purple sausage-shaped edible fruits. 
Traditionally, the vine is thought to be effective for treating rheumatism (Sikkim, India) and its stem, when bent into bangles, is believed to cure orthopedic problems (Darjeeling, India). 
Holboellia latifolia is a fantastic evergreen climber if you want to cover a wall or pergola quickly. … What makes Holboellia especially desirable is the insignificant but deliciously scented flowers which appear in early spring and last for many weeks. The greenish male flowers and the pink female flowers appear in clusters along the twining stems. They fill the garden with a scent of gardenias, especially strong during warmer spells. 
All it requires in return is a bit of shelter from the worst gales, a moist soil and a feed with blood, fish and bone every spring. 
Gardners and botanists on Twitter have also raved about the virtues of the sausage vine:

Holboellia latifolia 'sausage' fruit growing in Manipur, India..delicious! pic.twitter.com/npFGveAeQR — Paul Barney (@PaulEdulis) January 2, 2014 
The sausage vine's ties to a colonial past 
Roy Lancaster, a British plantsman, gardener, author, and broadcaster, traveled to Nepal in 1971 and left with 400 plant seeds including the sausage vine, according to his book A Plantsman in Nepal. 
Sausage vine studies date further back to the mid-1800s, at the height of British rule in India. Nepali botanist Kamal Maden says that Danish surgeon and botanist Nathaniel Wallich was the first to study the sausage vine species while working in India to establish the Calcutta Botanical Garden and named the plant after his ornithologist friend Carl Peter Holboell. 
Screenshot of a page from Nathaniel Wallich's notebook, #4950 details the Holbeoellia latifolia plant, 1821, used with permission. 
However, plant expert Robbie Blackhall-Miles writes recently in the Guardian that 'Holboellia' is named after Fred Louis Holboell, the superintendent of the Copenhagen Botanic Garden. 
Talking to Global Voices, Uttam Babu Shrestha, who worked on Indian flora for five years and was assigned to search literature and validate plant names at Harvard University confirmed: 
I don't know much about how it was named (species epithet). It was first published as Holboellia latifolia by Wallich in his Book 'Tentamen Florae Napalensis Illustratae' volume 1, section 24, page 16, 1824, and later, Wallich transferred it to Stauntonia latifolia in his catalogue (the name of the book is A Numerical List of Dried Specimens of Plants in the East India Company's Museum: Collected Under the Superintendence of Dr. Wallich of the Company's Botanical Garden at Calcutta)...Stauntonia latifolia is accepted name and Holboellia latifolia is basionym (synonym) and both are same species according to Wallich. 
Maden writes about the irony of the sausage vine: 
Not much can be found about this plant in research articles and books published in Nepal but more information is found in foreign countries. Nursery entrepreneurs can promote Gufala as an evergreen plant and a climber with beautiful flowers in the hilly cities. 
Q'eswachaka, the last Inca bridge that keeps communities together &middot; Global Voices

Of all the bridges that existed back then, the only one that remains today is the Q’eswachaka or Queshuachaca (literally, "rope bridge" in the Quechua language), which spans a narrow pass over the Apurímac River in the province of Canas, located in the southern region of Cusco. 
Ultimo puente Inca #Queshuachaca https://t.co/A9Qs5jFRYG pic.twitter.com/5283LESYgg — Inka Jungle (@inkajungle) 12 de junio de 2017 
Last Inca bridge, Queshuachaca. 
The Q'eswachaka is made out of ichu, a grass endemic to the Andean highlands. For more than 500 years, the local people have kept this tradition of ancient technology alive. Every year in June, the rural communities of Huinchiri, Chaupibanda, Choccayhua and Ccollana Quehue come together in a ritual ceremony to rebuild the bridge with the same raw materials and techniques used in the time of the Incas. 
In 2013, the knowledge, skills and rituals related to the annual renewal of the Q’eswachaka bridge were inscribed on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. 
According to that description: see it as a means of strengthening their social links and not simply as a transport route. 
The bridge is considered a sacred expression of the communities’ bond with nature, tradition and history 
The first day begins with an oblation to the protector Apu. The main material for the bridge is collected and twisted into narrow strands. 
In the afternoon, the communities bring the material together, twisting the narrow strands into thick ropes &#8212; four for the floor of the bridge, and two for the railings. The main ropes are then extended across the river. 
On the second day, they're secured to each side, and the old ropes are allowed to fall. 
On the third day, the chakaruhac (Inca engineer) braids the bridge together to give the bridge a surface to walk on and to stabilize the railings by connecting them to the base. 
Finally on the last day, the bridge is reopened with typical music and dances from the area. 
Getting across Queshuachaca, last Inca bride of Peru. 
A user posted on Twitter a video by AJ+ that shows how the bridge is braided every year: 
For centuries, the hanging bridge Q'eswachaka is braided once more. Inca beauty that we can learn from to collectively achieve. 
On Instagram, we can also find pictures of users who crossed the bridge: 
The women behind Armenia's "Velvet Revolution" &middot; Global Voices 
The following is a partner post by Global Voices’ partner Chai-Khana.org. Text and video by Aren Melikyan. 
Women are part of the reason Armenia now has the prime minister it does. Yet for many, the “revolution” that brought reform-minded protest leader Nikol Pashinyan to power this May has only just begun. 
The thousands of women who took to Armenia’s streets for roughly 40 days this spring were protesting not only for a change in government, but for their rights in a traditionally patriarchal society. 
For three of these protesters &#8212; Maria Karapetyan, 30, head of development for the Imagine Center for Conflict Transformation, Avnik Melikyan, 22, a project coordinator at the non-profit Society without Violence and 23-year-old political activist Lilith Baghdasaryan &#8212; that requires more than just a seat in parliament or in the cabinet. 
It requires changing attitudes and giving more Armenian women the skills they need to hold power. 
In that respect, these women protesters are, indeed, “revolutionaries.” 
Questions swirl over Japanese government's response to deadly, unprecedented rains &middot; Global Voices 
Flooding in Kurashiki, Okayama in western Japan. Screencap from NHK World-Japan. 
At least 178 people have died and more than 60 others are missing after much of western Japan was hit by torrential rainfall, the most in recorded history. 
Flooding has affected much of western Honshu, particularly the neighboring prefectures of Okayama and Hiroshima. As local authorities struggle to rescue stranded residents and restore basic services such as municipal water supplies, Japanese are increasingly demanding answers as to why the death toll is so high and why the central government seemingly reacted so slowly to the disaster. 
Record-breaking rains had already been falling for days as part of the annual Japanese rainy season when an even stronger rain front prompted Japan's meteorological authority to predict there would be widespread flooding on Thursday, July 5, especially in western Japan. 
By Thursday evening it was reported that some regions had already received more than 400 mm of precipitation over the previous 72 hours, or double the annual rainfall. 
But more was on the way. July 5 rainfall western Japan. 
Over the weekend, the rain did not let up. For the first time in its history, the Japanese Meteorological Agency issued flooding disaster warnings for eight prefectures (eventually it would be 11) at the same time. 
Kurashiki, a well-preserved tourist town in Okayama, received some of the worst flooding, with nearly 30 percent of the municipality affected. 
Torrential rains: Footage taken at 8:51 AM in the vicinity of Yata, in Makibi in the city of Kurashiki in Okayama. 
Houses are flooded to their rooftops. 
Hiroshima, another mountainous prefecture that neighbors Okayama to the west, made headlines due to numerous landslides that buried dozens of people alive. 
‘Why didn’t I tell her to evacuate?’ asks newlywed, after losing wife of three weeks in Hiroshima landslide https://t.co/ErU4sP9ajY — The Japan Times (@japantimes) July 10, 2018 
The rains affected almost every prefecture in Japan to the west of Mount Fuji. 
While on the east side of the city there were fears a dam might fail, the normally placid Kamo River that runs through western Kyoto became a raging torrent and threatened to flood the city's central shopping district. The Kamo River is flooding. 
Watanave said the tool will soon be online and available for use by the public. As mentioned in a previous tweet, are shown as an overlay on Google Earth. 
Anger mounts at a perceived lax government response 
By Monday, July 9, the multitude of disasters had been given an official name by the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA): 
News release (July 9, 2018): The JMA has officially named the disaster the "July 2018 Torrential Rains." 
Prime Minister Abe Shinzo and his cabinet started to receive criticism for failing to take action. Media coverage treated the ongoing deluge as a major crisis as early Thursday, July 5. 
Meanwhile on that Thursday, Abe and senior members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party spent a festive evening at a private event in Tokyo, toasting their efforts to secure Abe an unprecedented third term as head of the party and prime minister of Japan. The clock points past 8:30 PM . 
By this time wouldn't it have been clear just how much devastation there was? 
Publications such as left-leaning Asahi newspaper and tabloid Nikkan Gendai spent several days attacking the prime minister: 
From Nikkan Gendai tabloid: 
"While people were being engulfed by water, what was this government actually doing?" 
: "What do you mean 'the people's lives come first?'" 
"They were at a drinking party, planning their own political strategy or out visiting their cronies, preoccupied with keeping their regime alive. Reacting to the flooding crisis was pushed back as an afterthought, intensifying the damage." 
"Cabinet did nothing until July 7&#8243; 
Questions about why death toll and damage were so severe 
Prime Minister Abe managed to visit flood-stricken areas by Wednesday, July 11, nearly a week after it was apparent Japan was experiencing a major natural disaster. Besides a likely death toll surpassing 200, 70,000 homes across western Japan had been flooded and 2 million people had been forced to evacuate their homes. 
Increasingly, people are wondering why, in a country used to sudden torrential rains, the death toll has been so high. In Okayama Prefecture, which has so far experienced the highest number of deaths over the past week, the risk of flooding is said to have been known in advance. 
Linda Sieg, reporting for Reuters news agency, noted that one reason was that many people did not know where to go following evacuation alerts. 
As well, Japan has traditionally prepared for earthquakes rather than large-scale flooding, while many homes are built in landslide-prone locations due to lack of available land for housing. 
In the end, Mainichi newspaper observed, the sheer volume of water may have overwhelmed existing flood defenses. In the aftermath, questions are also being asked about how climate change may have contributed the disaster. The rise in average surface temperatures on Earth is forecasted to fuel an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as heavy rain, particularly in western Japan. 
While media in Western and English-speaking countries largely reported the heavy rains and flooding as a story about Japan, Japanese wire service Kyodo pointed out the disaster was just one of several weather events occurring at the same time around the world: 
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) announced on July 10 that, as Japan experienced torrential rains in July, North Africa and the west coast of North America observed recorded-breaking heat, while every part the world saw unusual climate patterns. 
Nishinippon Shimbun, a major daily based in Fukuoka that serves western Japan, also noted: 
As record-breaking torrential rains delivered enormous damage to western Japan, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued weather warnings to 11 prefectures, the greatest number of warnings at one time ever. 
While were described as a "once in 50 years" special weather warning, following the rainfall and floods in 2017, this is the second year in a row Fukuoka Prefecture has been issued this special warning. 
As unusual weather becomes the new normal, how are we to protect ourselves?

For the past three years, Alex Yakaumo has used knowledge of permaculture to educate people about the natural environment in Suriname. 
While chemicals are commonly used in Suriname's agricultural sector, there are opportunities for sustainable agriculture to take hold in the country, according to a 2012 report by the International Institute for Sustainability. 
However, there some constraints to overcome, and one of them is lack of training. Yakumo is helping to change that. After receiving his Permaculture Design Certificate (PDC) from the Caribbean Permaculture Research Institute of Barbados, he decided to dedicate his time to lecturing about self-sustaining agricultural ecosystems and hosting workshops in Commewijne, where he lives. 
Located on the right bank of the Suriname River, his community has since got involved with other like-minded organisations more inland, as well as with tribal villages. 
Yakaumo says he never pressures people to learn about the permaculture lifestyle; rather, he waits until they are ready to receive its principles &#8212; and from there, the education begins. 
"It is something that has to come from the people because it is for the people", he says. 
"So I'm not really forcing , I'm just offering this opportunity and if people are ready, they can participate." Some of the greatest rewards that people can reap from practicing permaculture include self-sustainability and not exposing themselves or the earth to harmful chemicals. On Yakaumo's Facebook page Permacultuur in Commewijne, people can get updates and reach out if they would like to attend a lecture or workshop. 
He spoke with Global Voices about his work.

Global Voices (GV): Explain the benefits of permaculture and why you took an interest in it. 
Alex Yakaumo (AY): I came to Suriname in 2011 to live self-sustainably. Before that, I lived in Holland, but I travelled for a few years, in India mostly, and I really got the taste of being free &#8212; just self-supporting &#8212; and when I came to Suriname, I eventually started looking for ways to grow in a sustainable way, and this is how I came across permaculture. I started to look for courses, and the second course was just starting in Barbados at the Caribbean Permaculture Research Institute. So, I was quite lucky. 
To me, permaculture is bringing the different components of nature together in such a way that they enhance each other for the benefit of all beings.

GV: What specific areas do you focus on when educating people? 
AY: I'm focusing now on teaching people how to grow without synthetic products. It's the starting point &#8212; because most people in Suriname only know how to use chemicals &#8212; chemical fertilisers and herbicides are so ingrained in the system. My first aim is really to get people to understand the purpose of the soil itself, so they can start to appreciate the benefit of healthy soil and stop spraying. 
School children learn about the principles of permaculture at one of the school garden projects with which Yakaumo is involved. Photo courtesy Permacultuur in Commewijne, used with permission. 
For the last two months I’ve been busy every weekend, training teachers. I'm also doing school garden projects with two organisations. 
There's a big interest in permaculture here, because most people know that all the vegetables are being sprayed and they really want to learn an alternative method, but nobody is sharing this knowledge. 
You just have to know the dynamics of nature, so we can let nature do the work for us instead of fighting against it. 
For such a small population , most of the time my lectures are full. Most of the time, a lot of people come because they are so interested in learning how to grow. Alex Yakaumo giving a lecture on permaculture in Suriname. 
I do a lecture, and based on the lecture, they have the opportunity to do a workshop. In the lecture, I am sharing an introduction about just one part of permaculture, which I call ecological gardening. 
That's the biggest interest now for people: how to grow their own vegetables. In my talk, I stress the importance of taking care of the earth, and explore the different dynamics of Mother Nature in a very basic way. 
I explain what soil is and talk about its importance. Then, I show them the pictures from my own garden &#8212; including composting &#8212; so they see what is possible. 
I talk about fertilisers; I talk about different herbicides and pesticides, and then I invite them to join the workshops so they can learn &#8212; the easy way &#8212; to set up their own garden, all with local resources, like branches, stems, and leaves. 
It's not so technical; it's really about giving people the experience, so they can relate to the concept a lot better. 
It's just opening people's eyes to what they already have &#8212; most of them have seen this already, but they couldn't connect the dots. I think permaculture really speaks to people. 
GV: Do you use social media to help raise awareness or increase participation? AY: Facebook is the most used social media platform over here. 
I'm not a big fan of it, but in this case it's the best way to reach people. I'm looking for help from social media professionals who like to do this sort of posting, so I can just oversee what's happening. Young boys hold vegetables grown using permaculture principles.

One of the greatest benefits of permaculture is that it fosters a sense of community. Photo courtesyPermacultuur in Commewijne, used with permission. 
GV: What goals do you have for the future? 
AY: I am looking to set up an organisation called Wholesome Living. Wholesome Living consists of five pillars: care of the mind, physical exercise, knowledge of food, permaculture or living in harmony with nature, and contributing to society in a beneficial way. This is my way of life. 
In the summer, the 'hanabi' at Huis Ten Bosch include an exhibition by the winners of famed fireworks competitions held each year at the theme park Hanabi World Cup. Ashiya Summer Carnival (Ashiya, Hyogo) 
Located near the port city of Kobe in western Japan, the Ashiya Summer Carnival celebrated its fortieth anniversary this year with a unique 'hanabi' show. Computers orchestrate all the music and fireworks in this show. 
The thousand-year-old Tenjin Festival, dedicated to Sugawara Michizane (the god of scholarship and learning), occurs between June and July every year and features a variety of events. As one of the most famous festivals in Japan, many people travel to the Okawa River in Osaka to see the Hommiya fireworks display on July 25, as seen above. 
The Tenjin Festival takes place in Kansai, the large urban area in western Japan that feature a cluster of large cities including Osaka, Kyoto and Kobe. 
The 2017 animated movie 'Fireworks' (打ち上げ花火、下から見るか? 横から見るか? Uchiage Hanabi, Shita kara Miru ka? Yoko kara Miru ka?) demonstrates the centrality of fireworks to Japanese culture: 
The pop song “Senko Hanabi” depicts what a hot summer evening in Japan looks like: The ongoing water crisis in Iran's Ahwaz region looming towards disaster &middot; Global Voices 
This image shows three water buffalos whose skin are melted down due to high temperatures, high salinity of water and water scarcity in the marshlands of Ahwaz region in the background. A female Ahwazi farmer puts her hands up in exasperation on a barren farm. Photo by Mehr News Agency, published with the intention to redistribute. 
Despite the Iranian establishment’s long-standing efforts to block media information, awareness is steadily increasing about the horrendous and rapidly worsening water crisis in the traditionally Arab region of Ahwaz in the south and south-west of the country. To observers without knowledge of the situation, it may seem that this escalating catastrophe is a natural disaster resulting from climate change. 
These policies have had inevitable results – desertification and mass migration of the Ahwazis to other areas of Iran or to other nations simply to survive. The Ahwazi people see this dam and river program, not as the result of incompetence but as part of a deliberate, long-term calculated policy of ethnic cleansing intended to change the demographic balance in the region, which is home to over 95 percent of the oil and gas resources claimed by Iran. 
The aim, in this view, is to force out most of the Arabs and end their claim to sovereignty or ownership of their resources. In the process, natural habitats, wildlife, crops, and farm animals are suffering horrendously, with environmentalists warning of ecological catastrophe if these problems are not addressed. The devastation of the Karoon River is typical of the massive damage caused by this program; once a major waterway feeding into the renowned marshlands and estuary on the Gulf, which was busy with oceangoing vessels and fishing boats and supplied water for agriculture and farming, it’s now reduced to a trickle in some parts, with the once-bounteous marine life almost completely extinguished. 
The regime’s construction of the Gotvand Dam whose bed is built on a salt flat is widely viewed as the principal factor in this devastation. The dam, widely and variously condemned as a “salinity factory”, an “exhibition of environmental lessons”, an “environmental disaster”, and “the great national mistake”, has increased the river’s salinity level by 25 percent, making the water toxic to marine life and undrinkable for other species, as well as being useless for irrigating crops. 
Hamza Kaabi, an Arab farmer from the rural area of Howeyzeh told Global Voices despairingly through a WhatsApp conversation: We’ve been abandoned here. 
So many locals here have been poisoned by drinking the contaminated water, with many, including children and elderly people, having severe dysentery. We don’t even have an emergency health clinic to go to for treatment – we have to travel hundreds of kilometers to get to the hospitals in Ahwaz. 
Kaabi continued: 
The regime massacred and buried all of us, human and animals alike. Where are those humanitarians and environmental activists who fight for the environment to help stop our slow death? According to Iranian news agencies, the deterioration of the quality of the brackish, foul-smelling drinking water provided to Ahwazis has resulted in poisoning dozens of Arab residents in the cities of Rofaye and Howeyzeh and Ramez. 
Meanwhile, the shortage of water for agricultural use has resulted in farmers being driven to the brink of destitution, with crops withering due to the salinity and toxicity of the remaining polluted water supply, which is heavily polluted not only by the dumping of untreated sewage directly into the waterways but by the oil and gas refineries releasing toxic chemicals into them. This is further magnified by the government turning much of the region over to a ruinously expensive sugarcane growing program, which costs far more money than it makes, with refineries built on the riverbanks using the rivers’ remaining waters in the water-intensive refining process before dumping the residue polluted with chemicals used in the refinery process back into the water. 
The farmers’ pleas to provide alternative water sources have fallen on deaf ears, with desertification accelerating as the rivers are reduced to a salty trickle, leaving the farmers without water for their farmlands or even for their own survival and that of their livestock. 
Although palm trees are capable of surviving in harsh desert heat, they need water and the lack of any fresh water and the salinity of the remaining water supply means those in Ahwaz are dying off. 
In a document about the current crisis, the Deputy Rural Cooperative Organization of Ahwaz explained that ‘the inflow volume of Karoon River water has been severely reduced. As a result of the low water level in the river, we’ve witnessed a surge of salty water from the Gulf into the Karoon River, which increased the salinity level of the water in this river.’ Farmer Khalaf Ghezi, from Ahwazi rural areas, veered between despair and anger at the bleak situation and the regime’s refusal to intervene or help the people: 
Why don’t the authorities listen to our voices? Our Buffaloes are dying because of the river drying up. We don’t have jobs. 
If these animals are starved, we will starve too. While the massive profits from the oil and gas resources from the Ahwaz region goes straight to the Iranian regime’s coffers, with the Ahwazi people attaining no benefit from their natural resources; it’s common to hear Ahwazis lament the discovery of oil and gas since both are widely seen as having brought nothing but oppression, poverty and suffering, along with the pollution from their extraction. 
Tuberculosis Survivors Advocate To Eradicate The Disease From India &middot; Global Voices 
Used with Permission. March 24th marks World Tuberculosis (TB) Day. 
TB is one of world’s leading infectious diseases and affects more than 2.4 billion people &#8212; almost one-third of the world’s population. According to World Health Organisation (WHO) statistics, India is the country most heavily burdened by TB and many feel that the country isn't doing enough to stay ahead of the disease.

TB in India 
Out of a global incidence of 9.6 million cases, 2.2 million cases of TB are from India. This continues to cause a severe health and economic crisis in India as the disease costs the country close to $24 billion each year. 
In 2007, the prevalence of TB per 100,000 people was relatively high in Asia, and was highest in sub-Saharan Africa. Image from Wikimedia Commons. Public Domain 
Many feel that the existing support and awareness to fight TB In India is not adequate for patients. In a Huffington Post piece, Dr. Madhukar Pai speaks about the challenges involved with fighting TB in India: 
India also has the highest number of patients with multidrug-resistant TB in the world, including cases nearly impossible to cure. 
Although India has the world's largest TB epidemic, quality of TB care remains suboptimal, especially in the private and informal sector, where most patients seek initial care. The average TB patient is diagnosed only after several months and seeing multiple providers, most of whom do not follow standard guidelines. 
In India, nutrition, poverty, and TB are very much linked. People affected with TB frequently face severe economic barriers to health care, such as high expenses related to diagnosis and treatment, and suffering due to loss of income. A health ministry proposal for a monthly cash benefit of Indian Rs 500 (US$ 8) to all tuberculosis patients is facing resistance. 
This includes developing the Standards for TB Care in India, introducing daily drug regimens and rolling out molecular and drug-susceptibility testing. The government of India has also made TB a notifiable disease, that means all private doctors, caregivers and clinics treating a patient suffering from TB will have to report every single case of the air-borne disease to the government.

TB survivors against TB 
Launched in August 2016, Survivors Against TB (SATB) is a movement led by a group of TB survivors who are working to strengthen India’s fight against TB. These survivors have had their struggles with TB and based on their own experiences, they advocate for a patient-centered approach to effective TB prevention and control in India. 
In 2017, Survivors Against TB launched India’s first Hindi digital interface on tuberculosis. The portal aims to help TB affected communities by offering them important information about the disease. 
Another feature of this platform is to profile numerous TB survivors who work as advocates that disseminate stories and information about treatment, mental health, gender and stigma. 
In the above video, Deepti Chavan, an MDR-TB (multi-drug resistant TB) survivor based in Mumbai, tells the story of her fight against TB in the Hindi language. 
Last year, SATB launched a book, Nine Lives — Women and Tuberculosis in India, which profiled nine female TB survivors who, despite stigma and discrimination, successfully fought TB. 
SATB's Talking TB app focuses on disseminating information about key issues related to TB including side effects, stigma, nutrition, and treatment.

From the 2017 Global Voices Summit in Colombo, Sri Lanka: Into the Deep Podcast &middot; Global Voices 
Last December, in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in a small hotel game room with decent acoustics &#8212; and with a tropical storm brewing outside &#8212; ten Global Voices contributors from around the world gathered in a room to talk about international friendship, cross-cultural collaboration and the value of community. They were among the hundred authors, translators and editors from 60 countries who had gathered at the Mount Lavinia hotel for the biennial Global Voices summit to discuss the future of media, community, and the organization itself. 
Into the Deep is the Global Voices podcast where we dig deep into one topic that isn’t getting the media coverage it deserves. 
And in this podcast we are going to be giving you a glimpse of the latest Global Voices summit. 
Global Voices is an international network of passionate people who keep tabs on the online conversations happening in their regions. Our more than 1400, mostly volunteer, contributors cover stories from 167 countries and translate them into more than 30 languages. Together, we’ve been building bridges of understanding, as we like to call them, through our digital reporting since 2005.

Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code was a legacy of the British empire, who around the mid-19th century imposed many laws criminalizing homosexual acts across its colonies. In a historic verdict, Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra said: 
Majoritarian views and popular views cannot dictate constitutional rights. 
LGBT community possesses human rights like all other sections of society. Equality is the essence of the constitution. 
377 is arbitrary. 
Back in 2013, the Delhi High Court ruled Section 377 unconstitutional, but this had been overturned shortly after by the Supreme Court. 
The latest Supreme Court's decision has brought joy to people across the country, gay or otherwise. 
On social media, many acknowledged that such victory is the result of years of activism by India’s LGBT community. 
Educator Danish Sheikh wrote in Facebook: 
For 29 years, I have lived in the shadow of this law, and now, just like that, it’s gone. 
Jayna Kothari, executive director for the Center For Law And Policy Research, said: 
In the words of Justice Indu Malhotra that history owes them and their families an apology for criminalizing them for so many years - today’s decision is a remarkable recognition of the equality and dignity of LGBT persons. 
Others cheered the decision on Twitter: 
I'm thrilled that India has finally repealed the colonial-era law criminalizing gay sex, a law imposed by the British during imperial rule. 
The decision will not reflect in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir state as it has its own constitution and criminal law, the Ranbir Penal Code, which still criminalizes non-heterosexual sexual intercourse. 
Dr. Ajaz Ahmad Bund, a social worker in Kashmir, told the Times of India: 
The Supreme Court judgment, I am hoping, will now initiate a debate and awareness about what it means to be gay or lesbian or transgender in Kashmir. 
Fans around the world celebrate as Akira turns 30 &middot; Global Voices 
On July 16, 2018, netizens around the world marked the thirtieth anniversary of the release of Akira, a groundbreaking film that revolutionized and influenced how animation forever. 
To mark the occasion, fans from Japan and beyond shared their favorite scenes from the movie &#8212; and why, thirty years on, Akira remains so fascinating to so many people. 
Akira was written and directed by Otomo Katsuhiro, in 1988 already a legendary manga artist in Japan, and based on his popular manga series of the same name, which had been initially been published as a monthly serial starting in 1982. The story takes place in the year 2019 in a post-apocalyptic Neo-Tokyo, an authoritarian police state where protests are repressed, corruption runs rampant and the rule of law is nothing but a façade. Childhood friends Kaneda and Tetsuo lead a local biker gang when a motorcycle accident wakes in the latter powerful psionic abilities, testing their relationship and threatening the military complex that rules over them. 
As with so much of post-war Japanese pop culture, Akira's themes of destruction, hopelessness, and resilience echo the real-life events of 1945, when the United States dropped atomics on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, with the two attacks immediately killing at least 200,000 people. 
Both the manga series and the 1988 movie are cyberpunk tour-de-force that includes amphetamine-popping motorcycle punks, sophisticated military hardware, and transhumanism. In the movie, the explosive cataclysm that gave rise to Neo-Tokyo took place on July 16, 1988. 
In the real world, the movie was also first released on this date, and this anniversary was celebrated around the world, including in Japan. Happy Birthday AKIRA for the 30th anniversary 🥳🎂 😍#AKIRA #アキラ #AKIRA_Animation_30th_Anniversary pic.twitter.com/mLopBI1RY7 — じょお (@llJooHll) July 17, 2018 
On this day, July 16th of 1988, Akira destroyed the original Tokyo. 
As part of a global online celebration under the hashtag #AkiraWeek, the Japan Times produced a series of articles devoted to Akira spearheaded by pop culture writer Matt Schley. 
In one of his articles in the series, Schley explains to Japan Times readers how to speak Japanese like a biker punk, while providing some useful background vocabulary to help understand the movie: 
That film, and the manga that inspired it, are set in the far-flung year of 2019, when Tokyo has been destroyed by a 新型爆弾 (shingata bakudan, new type of bomb) that started 第三次世界大戦 (Daisanji Sekai Taisen, World War III). 
For many fans, the film's virtuoso visual style is what makes Akira so memorable: AKIRA (1988) is an animated masterpiece. 
It is completely mindblowing how much work must have gone into some of the animated sequences and backgrounds. pic.twitter.com/yOdyJywA9B — Rocket Adrift (@RocketAdrift) August 13, 2018 
In a thread that went viral on Twitter, one Akira fan took a close look at what made the movie's animation so compelling: 
Alright, let's take a closer look at some of these pencil tests from Akira! Look at this amazing tracking shot! 
There's dozens of individually interesting animations happening in here, but they flow together so cohesively. 
The public installations of illustrations from the manga and the animated film also appeared, as observed by another Twitter user: 
A screentone of a giant Testuo (the main antagonist in the manga series and in the animated film) in Shibuya (in Tokyo). I think I prefer Moiré pattern-technique myself. For many people around the world, the story and themes of Akira continue to be thought-provoking. 
“In 1988, Akira looked and sounded like nothing I’d ever seen. 
It was long, yet insanely fast. And by the end of it, I had no more of a clue what it was about than I had done at the start.”@DavidBennun on 30 years of anime’s blockbuster masterpiece.https://t.co/hni0NJCEyv pic.twitter.com/MWA5bbB505 — The Quietus (@theQuietus) July 8, 2018 
In an essay to mark the thirtieth anniversary of Akira, essayist David Bennun writes: 
What I now grasp is that it was, and is, different in Japan. For the simple and very good reason that Japan was, and is – and we can only hope remains – the only nation to have actually experienced nuclear warfare. 
You can explore further commentary on Akira through the hashtags #アキラ, #Akira, #Akira30, and #AKIRA_Animation_30th_Anniversary. 
For a good overview of Akira's plot and characters, here's a fan-made English-language trailer of the movie: 
Brazil grieves as its oldest treasures turn to ashes in National Museum fire &middot; Global Voices 
Firefighters tried to put out the fire at the National Museum for hours. The lack of water was a problem | Image: Screenshot from Felipe Milanez's Facebook live 
Brazilians were left heartbroken after the National Museum, the country's oldest and arguably its most important, guardian of Latin America's largest natural history and anthropology collection, burned to the ground on Sunday, September 3, in a fire that raged throughout the night. 
The National Museum was founded in Rio de Janeiro in 1818 by the then king of Portugal, D. João VI. It was housed in a palace of around the same period. The site had been the residence of the Portuguese and Brazilian royal families until 1889. It's also where Brazil's first National Constitutional Assembly was held. 
Over its 200 years of history &#8212; the museum's anniversary was celebrated just in June this year &#8212; it assembled a collection of around 20 million items. While a complete list of destroyed items is yet to be released, treasures such the eldest human fossil found in the Americas, pieces from ancient Egypt and the original letter that abolished slavery in Brazil in 1888 have all been confirmed lost. 
Some people, including the museum's staff and scientists, risked their own lives by breaking into the blazing building to retrieve some of the items. 
While the number of visitors had been dwindling every year &#8212; more Brazilians visited the Louvre in 2017 than the National Museum -, online reactions following the news of the fire were plenty. 
Journalist and professor Felipe Milanez live-streamed the museum as the fire was raging: 
One Twitter user posted a long thread, with images, of what might be lost in the fire: 
lady's Sha-Amun-in-su skiff. Egypt, Low Season, c. 750 BC 
Mask of the female secret society Gelede, no date. And there is still the building itself 
A video posted by the facebook page Realidade Simulada gives an aerial view of the museum as it was before the fire: 
﻿ 
The price of not caring After the tragedy, people remembered how the authorities have neglected the National Museum for years. The museum is managed by the public and increasingly underfunded Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). 
Luísa Nunes, a student of the university, remembered on Twitter that this was the sixth major fire in UFRJ's buildings since 2011. 
2011, Palace of the Praia Vermelha. 
2012, Faculty of Letters 
2014, Laboratory of the Center for Health Sciences 
2016, Rectory 
2017, Student Housing 
2018, National Museum These are the buildings in the custody of UFRJ that have suffered episodes of fire in the last decade. 
The two hydrants nearby the museum were dry, so firefighters had to improvise by pumping water out of a nearby lake, losing 40 minutes of work in the process. The museum's annual budget, of around 500,000 reais a year (125,000 US dollars), has suffered significant cuts over the past four years, local newspaper Folha de S.Paulo revealed in a story from May 2018. 
Twitter user DanPimpao posted a graph showing how much have been cutted from the museum's budget since 2013: 
Budget of the National Museum from 2013 to 2018. Analyze yourselves and draw your own conclusions. The museum on fire. 
Image by Felipe Milanez, used with permission. 
On its 200th anniversary, its management launched a crowdfunding campaign to to reopen a relevant collection room, where was the skeleton of the Maxakalisaurus, the first large dinosaur assembled in Brazil. 58 thousand reais were collected from the initial goal of 30 thousand reais - however the ideal would be to raise 100 thousand reais. Professor Stevens Rehen commented on Facebook: 
At the 200th anniversary party, no state minister attended. 
The budget has plunged from R $ 531,000 in 2013 to R $ 54,000 in 2018. This year, the government's total investment in the National Museum equals a quarter of what each Congressmen's budget to hire advisors. 
A Twitter user compared the amount with other government expenses: 
The annual budget of the National Museum corresponds to: - 30 'of electoral propaganda 
- 0.0004% of the cost of renovation of Maracanã stadium 
- the cost of 1 federal judge / year 
The museum was just about to receive extra resources National Bank of Economic and Social Development from to implement a fire-safety plan. 
The first installment was due in October. 
The fire of the National Museum is the merciless metaphor of a country that disparages science, knowledge and, above all, history. 
Mexicans celebrate indigenous cuisine with an online healthy food challenge &middot; Global Voices

A new online challenge in Mexico is encouraging people to eat healthy by returning to the nation's indigenous roots. 
Under the hashtag #RetoTlacoyo, people share photos of tlacoyo, a nutritious pre-Hispanic snack consisting of corn tortilla filled with beans, lima beans and curd cheese (but ingredients tend to vary a lot). 
The challenge was launched by Alianza por la Salud Alimentaria (Alliance for Health Nutrition), a civil society organization, as a way to encourage people to choose nutritious Mexican cuisine over junk food. 
Reporte Indigo describes tlacoyo this way: 
According to some reports, the Spanish tried tlacoyos for the first time in the markets of Tlatelolco and they liked it so much that they included this dish in their diet, adding beef and dairy products to it. 
Obesity is a serious public health concern in Mexico, which consumes more ultra-processed foods than most Latin American countries. 
The promoters of #RetoTacloyo are sharing contributions on their official Twitter account: Photo: Join the Tlacoyo Challenge. 
Value our cooking. 
WORLD HERITAGE. A highly-nutritious, non-expensive popular dish that contains some of the most important ingredients found in our diet. Embedded tweet: Tlacoyos from abroad...why should a Mexican lose the tradition of a good and healthy diet. 
The #RetoTlacoyo has spread beyond our national borders! 👏

A new indie film festival features the struggles and triumphs of indigenous Papua, Indonesia &middot; Global Voices A few participants in the second Papuan independent film festival.

Papuan Voices, a video advocacy organization, has organized two independent film festivals since 2017 to celebrate the lives and struggles of indigenous Papuans in the southeastern province of Indonesia. 
In 2015, Global Voices first featured Papuan Voices as a project with EngageMedia, and during the same year, Papuan Voices established itself as an independent organization with a presence now in six Papuan regions. 
As the country’s most resource-rich but cash-poor area, a recent influx of Indonesians from other regions has displaced many indigenous Papuans. Some Papuans decry it as an illegal occupation and demand their independence from Indonesia.

Within this context, as the first film festival held in Papua, it aimed: 
to highlight the issues of the indigenous people of Papua through documentary films as well as to build public awareness of the important issues impacting them. Nearly 30 films were submitted, 50 people participated in the pre-festival production workshops, and 10 films were produced through youth-focused workshops. 
Today is the first day of a pre-festival film workshop in Keerom regency Papua (after last week in Jayapura) organized by the #PapuanVoices community. 
These workshops are encouraging local filmmakers to prepare and submit films for the #FestivalFilmsPapua2018 Stay tuned for more pic.twitter.com/q4C4xk9MvX — EngageMedia (@EngageMedia) June 4, 2018 Mecky Yeimo, a film festival participant, said that the films provided a lot of information about the land disputes between indigenous Papuan landowners and investors acquiring local lands for mining and palm plantations. 
Franky Samperante, the director of Pusaka, an indigenous Indonesian non-governmental organization, noted the importance of the film festival: 
In Papua, there are very limited options to obtain information by ordinary people because information is controlled by certain dominant groups. 
The information in these films will be very useful for many people at the local, national and international levels. 
Many of the films featured during both festivals depict the everyday struggles of Papuans. 
For example, the 2017 Best Film award winner ‘Monce Truck’ is a documentary directed by Imanuel Hindom about a former truck driver for a palm oil plantation in Keerom Regency who found a way to help Papuan women sellers ("Mama-mama" in Papuan) find a new source of income by transporting their vegetables to new markets in the capital city of Jayapura: 
‘The Caretaker of Isio Hill Forest’ is another inspiring short documentary which narrates the story of Alex Waisimon who turned a lush forest in Papua into a famous bird-watching spot for tourists. 
Since 2011, both Papuan Voices and EngageMedia have trained more than 50 filmmakers and produced approximately 100 films which were screened in more than 50 locations in and out of Indonesia. 
The last residents of a dying Armenian village &middot; Global Voices 
The following is a story by Chai-Khana.org and is republished by Global Voices under a partnership agreement. 
Text and video by Lilit Mkhitaryan. 
Lernagyugh, an Armenian village 150 kilometers from capital Yerevan, is dying. While it was once a robust community, just four people remain there today. The village is remote, closed off from the rest of the country during the winter, and it lacks even basic services, like schools. 
The situation has become so dire that Nikol Martirosyan, 60, and his wife Haykush Nikoghosyan – one of the two remaining families in the village – are thinking of leaving. 
Hrant Minasyan and his wife Margarit Kchoyan, the other remaining family, have lived in the village for 30 years. Hrant is 62 and has little hope that his family will remain in Lernagyugh after he dies: one of his two sons works abroad and the second has already resettled in a different village. 
Rare film footage with sound of Kyoto, Japan, from 1929 &middot; Global Voices 
Kyoto, Japan, in 1929. 
Screencap from "1929 - Early Sound Footage of Kyoto, Japan", edited and uploaded to YouTube by Guy Jones. 
A popular YouTube channel has uploaded restored newsreel footage of Kyoto from 1929. 
What makes this film notable is that it features actual sound footage of Japanese city life at that time. 
Usually, newsreels from that era are silent. 
The newsreel includes market scenes, a ceremony at a Shinto shrine and young women playing traditional games, all with clear sound. 
In this case, the amazing period sound was captured by Movietone cameras, which were state-of-the-art for 1929. 
This footage comes from University of South Carolina Moving Image Research Collections (MIRC), caretaker of the Fox Movietone News Collection. 
Note: This article has been updated to reflect that the source of the newsreel footage is the MIRC, with thanks to Dan Streible. 
Why are Armenian displaced persons still living in a hotel, 30 years after fleeing Azerbaijan? 
&middot; Global Voices The Naira hotel in Yerevan is a home to refugees from Azerbaijan.

The following is a story by Chai-Khana.org and is republished by Global Voices under a partnership agreement. Text and video by Aren Melikyan and Hermine Virabian. The number 29 on the sign should be changed to 30, as 30 years have now passed since 64 refugee families first moved into Hotel Nairi in Yerevan. 
Today, the hotel is home to three generations, including the grandchildren and the children of the people who were forced to flee Azerbaijan in the 1980s, during the period leading up to the Karabakh conflict. 
Despite the wait, they have not lost hope that one day they will be given houses in Armenia. 
For years, many of their calls and written pleas for help have fallen on deaf ears. 
Even those who have received answers from officials got nothing but promises. 
After thirty years of living in 11-square-meter “apartments” in a building notable for its poor infrastructure, some families are demanding new living quarters from the state. 
But they fear in doing so they risk losing the rooms they have at Hotel Nairi. 
Japan mortgages its future, choosing growth over environment &middot; Global Voices

This past summer, amidst fears that summer temperatures throughout the country might rise to an unheard of high of 45 degrees, the Japanese prime ministerial race proceeded on its conservative course. 
For incumbent Abe Shinzo, the process was necessary to affirm the Liberal Democratic Party's loyalty. 
He needed to make sure that the allegiances of factions had not shifted as a result of the numerous scandals associated with his inner circle during his second term of office. 
But apparently, the Moritomo Gakuin scandal, in which the prime minister was believed to have secretly supported the building of an ultra-right-wing school in Osaka created to revive fanatical emperor worship and militaristic education, had lost its sting. 
And despite the polls and surveys showing that the public suspected the prime minister had compromised his principles in the Moritomo and other scandals, Abe won by a significant margin. 
A few days after he secured his victory, Abe published an article in the UK-based Financial Times. 
Entitled “Join Japan and act now to save our planet”, Abe's piece invited readers to start tackling climate change, even as his administration paradoxically moved ahead to set up hazardous coal-fired power stations.

Over the summer, while Abe’s colleagues were addressing each other in politely coded language, the rest of the country was beginning to demand a more effective response to the natural catastrophes that now seem commonplace in Japan. 
A June earthquake in Osaka that left five dead set the stage for a record-breaking season of typhoons and extreme flooding and destructive storms that battered much of western Japan over the course of three months. 
Kansai International Airport, the second largest in the country, was knocked out of commission for days due to extensive runway flooding and the collapse of a bridge. 
Prioritizing climate change 
Even in the face of undeniable climate change in Japan, the Abe administration’s agenda is unwaveringly fixed on the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, constitutional reform, and, of course, economic growth. 
While there is serious criticism about hosting the Olympics in August due to high temperatures and humidity, Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has vowed to maintain the status quo, because changing the timing of the summer games could have adverse economic effects in Japan. 
This is an ironic position considering that the 1964 Tokyo Olympics took place in October, when Japanese sports festivals (undokai) are traditionally held. 
Climate change (kiko hendo) and global warming (ondanka) are familiar words in Japanese, of course, but the causes of temperature rise have not sufficiently been linked to unrestricted economic growth and corporate greed. 
Two decades ago, Japan presented itself as an eco-conscious nation by proposing the Kyoto Treaty, but as Abe and his neo-conservative clique took over the cabinet the party’s priorities once again shifted toward free trade and less restricted economic growth. 
Despite the LDP’s vision of “taking Japan back” (Nihon wo torimodosu) to its pre-bubble era level of economic ascendency, the gap between the rich and poor is becoming harder to ignore. 
Choosing economic growth over the environment 
From predictions that malaria and dengue fever will spread quickly once the temperature rises a few more degrees, to the even more devastating thought that the main island of Honshu will become uninhabitable unless the population is cloistered in perpetually air-conditioned buildings, perhaps the most common response in Japan is to maintain a stubborn reticence, or to shrug one’s shoulders and utter the hackneyed phrase shikataganai (there’s nothing to be done). 
As in other European and North American countries, many citizens of Japan seem to think that the retired workaholic generation, known as the dankai sedai, achieved an astonishing economic miracle as they rebuilt a country left totally devastated by war. 
Left unexamined is the reality that this “miracle” resulted in promoting an excessive lifestyle of over-consumption that—as the global population increases ever more and as natural resources are depleted, corrupted or destroyed—is clearly unsustainable. 
One could speculate that the Japanese militarism of the early Showa period has simply been channeled into fanatical devotion to the principle of economic growth. 
What will future generations think? 
How will future generations ultimately judge “Abenomics” that prioritized economic growth at the expense of the natural environment? 
Will Japanese businesses pay the price for creating ever greater economic inequality while simultaneously demanding more long hours of work of those of both genders, single or married and regardless of familial commitments, in return for minimal salaries? 
Will the ultimate destruction of numerous animal and plant species in just a few decades be an acceptable price for economic growth? 
Even in a nation that clings to the status quo, there are occasional protests. 
During the Meiji Restoration beginning in the late 1860s, and before and after World War II, there were watershed moments when the public blamed Japanese leaders and economic magnates for nearly destroying the social fabric. 
Will there ever come a point at which the younger generation will hit the streets in anger and rail against the hazards of over-consumption? 
A conversation with Gyani Maiya Sen, one of the last speakers of a dying Nepali language &middot; Global Voices 
Gyani Maiya Sen Kusunda. 
Image by author. 
For years, people knew very little about the Kusunda language of western and central Nepal. 
The 2011 Census conducted by Nepal’s Central Bureau of Statistics puts the population of Kusundas, a forest tribe of western Nepal, at around 273. 
To learn more about the language and the culture of the Kusunda people, Global Voices spoke with Gyani Maiya Sen Kusunda &#8212; one of only two fluent speakers of the dying Kusunda language. 
'The kings of the forest' 
It was hot and humid, the roads were empty, and not even the battery-powered Tuk-Tuk drivers were willing to offer us a ride. 
With heavy tripods, cameras and other filming equipment, we headed to Gyani Maiya Sen’s house in Kulmor village in Nepal’s Dang district. 
Gyani Maiya Sen Kusunda, in her early 80s, is one of the only two fluent speakers of the dying Kusunda language. 
The population of Kusundas is believed to be 273; however, field studies by researchers have shown only 150 of them dispersed in the Dang, Rolpa, Pyuthan, Arghakhanchi, and Surkhet districts of Nepal. 
Kusundas have settled in villages after their forefathers spent their lives in jungles and caves as nomadic tribesmen. 
They would visit the villages only to beg alms, and many Kusundas still feel embarrassed to reveal their surname as they are still treated as ‘people from the jungle’. 
Kusundas claim themselves to be ban rajas, the kings of the forest.

Kusunda language is an isolated language which means it is not related to any other languages in the world. 
Unfortunately, it is also defined by a younger generation, that has stopped speaking it &#8212; leaving the language to slowly fade out as the older generations pass away. 
Besides Gyani Maiya, her sister Kamala, in her early 50s, is another fluent speaker of the language from their community. 
Uday Raj Aaley, a researcher devoted to reviving the Kusunda language, also speaks Kusunda language. 
However, Gyani Maiya fears whether her granddaughter Rakshya will ever speak her mother tongue and keep the tradition alive. 
When we met Gyani Maiya, she was busy peeling green mangoes together with her granddaughter. 
She was teaching her granddaughter to peel, slice and dry the mangoes for future use but unfortunately, they were talking in Nepali.

No hooves, only claws 
As we started talking to Gyani Maiya and she started telling us about their culture and tradition, a stray cow entered the barn. 
When she returned back, she talked to us about Kusunda food habits. 
She said, “Kusundas avoid animals with hooves but love eating ones with claws.” 
They wouldn’t even touch cattle including goats and pigs. 
They would neither kill a deer nor eat venison which shows how they co-exist with nature. 
However, they love eating birds, a pheasant being their favorite. 
And the monitor lizard is their preferred hunt. 
It's so special that it has become a part of the bridal ceremony, as they need to present its egg, meat, clothes and of course some money to the would-be bride's family. 
If they can’t find a monitor lizard egg, the initial conversation can’t happen between the interested parties. 
And no monitor lizard meat means ‘no marriage’ at all. 
The bag and the snare.

Still hunting and gathering 
She then unpacked a tangled bulk of cords. 
The mesh of cords was a snare to trap jungle fowls and bag meant to carry the trapped birds. 
Made from cords extracted from wild creepers, the snare is called 'aant' and the bag is called 'aamji' in Kusunda language. 
As the birds pass through the trees, they get trapped and then they catch and carry those birds in this bag with perforations. 
While we were busy documenting the special words of Kusunda language, I could see a swarm of tiny insects heading to a small hole in a wooden log. 
Neither honey bees nor flies, they are called ‘putka’ according to Gyani Maiya and they yield honey-like sweet substance. 
Finally, Gyani Maiya showed us her barn. 
She had planted yams in every nook and cranny. 
For a woman of above 80, she was still a strong figure. 
And above all, her commanding tone was the evidence of the aura she might have carried around when she was young &#8212; powerful like a ‘queen of the jungle'.

17 Pieces of Wisdom from Nelson Mandela that Everyone Needs to Read &middot; Global Voices 
Nelson Mandela was the first democratically elected president of South Africa. 
Photo released by South Africa The Good News under Creative Commons (CC BY 2.0). 
Nelson Mandela, the first democratically elected president of South Africa and a Noble Peace Prize laureate, died on December 5, 2013 aged 95. 
Mandela spent 27 years in jail for his struggle against South Africa's system of racial segregation known as apartheid. 
Freed from prison in 1990, he became president four years later, and left office after serving only one term, a rare gesture in African politics. 
The internationally beloved statesman had an impressive way with words. 
One of his most famous quotes comes from a defiant speech he made in court during his Rivonia treason trial in 1964, in which he said: 
I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. 
I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. 
It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. 
But, if need be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die. 
Apart from his Rivonia trial speech, Mandela leaves behind many memorable and wise quotes made throughout his life. 
Despite his passing, he continues to speak to the world through Twitter users, who have reacted to news of his death by sharing his words.

The first graduating class (2011) of Wapishana teachers after receiving their certificates to return to their villages to teach Wapishana literacy to others.

In the midst of Guyana's lush rainforests, nestled between the Rupununi River and Brazilian border, dwells the Indigenous Wapishana tribe. 
Linguist and cultural activist Adrian Gomes hails from an isolated Wapishana village, yet, he speaks less Wapishana — an Indigenous Arawakan language spoken in Guyana and Brazil —than English. 
Now, he's trying to revive the dying language. 
According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, more than 40 percent of the world’s languages are endangered. 
In 1997, concerned about the dwindling number of Wapishana-literate adults, Gomes formed the Wapichan Wadauniinao Ati’o (WWA, meaning "Wapishana for our Descendants"), to help revive the Wapishana language. 
In 2011, the WWA embarked on a four-year Wapishana Adult Literacy Programme to preserve the community's language, culture and land resources, in keeping with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples recommendations. 
Gomes says that by preserving endangered languages, people access their stories in their own tongue, thereby retaining strong roots. 
Language is about communication — but it's also an instrument of knowledge and power. 
Gomes maintains: 
In our part of the world of formerly colonised countries, ‘true decolonisation’ is still lacking, for there is still the continuation of colonial structures and mentalities in the context of the independent nations. 
Global Voices corresponded with Gomes via email about his vision for the Wapishana language.

Global Voices (GV): What inspired you to want to preserve this language and how do you see it making a difference? 
Adrian Gomes (AD): I realised that I did not know my own cultural heritage or background very well, despite being able to speak the language. 
It’s not that the knowledge was hidden, but due to my exposure to mainstream culture, I had not been actively involved in the activities of my culture. 
I missed out on a lot on trips to the deep forest and the wide-ranging savannah ... and the practical lessons passed on by our elders through on-the-spot occurrences ... 
I felt incomplete when it came to knowing my roots — I missed a sense of belonging — of being Wapishana. 
I wanted to do something about it. 
Guyana's 9,000-strong Wapishana population was no longer equivalent to the number of speakers (around 5,000 or less). 
As people favoured the national language, English, as well as Creole and even Portuguese, our Indigenous language was no longer being passed on to the next generation. 
There is a growing number of young adults who speak only English. 
The WWA's literacy programme has revitalised the language in 17 villages in south Rupununi by increasing literacy at the grassroots level. 
This ... gave people a sense of pride and expanded their self-esteem. 
There are now approximately 1,000 Wapishana-literate people. 
GV: What other activities does the WWA undertake? 
AG: At the WWA centre, we archive language data, strengthen the capacity of local WWA tutors to train others, promote the language through reading and spelling competitions, and collaborate with like-minded partners. 
People have even been inspired to produce their own reading materials. 
The WWA is recognised as the local authority for the translation of certain documents, and we have got approval from the Ministry of Education for a Wapishana/English pilot project in three villages ... 
GV: What have been some of the challenges? 
AG: Through the literacy courses, we have managed to preserve the language to a large extent; However, participation dwindled toward the end of the four-year programme. 
Part of the struggle was that we also needed a more advanced level programme. 
A considerable number of youth were not motivated enough to participate ... English tends to be promoted, celebrated and exalted at the expense of native languages, which are seen as old fashioned. 
The WWA has to create programmes that span generations ... 'create space' for the Wapishana language in modern technology ... 
Students learning to read and write in the Wapishana language.

GV: Do technological tools benefit language preservation? 
AG: Digital media and technology have helped in archiving materials ... at the disposal of younger Wapishana who want to get connected with their cultural heritage. 
The community radio station facilitates programmes and songs in Wapishana, as well as storytelling and literacy lessons. 
It sends the message that our Indigenous language is affirmed and valued. 
In principle, there is no reason why we cannot have access to digital tools such as WhatsApp or Facebook. 
Like the Wayana community in Suriname, we can use the Wapishana language to send messages to one another via these networking platforms to increase our reach. 
Adrian Gomes at Leiden University in The Netherlands, where he is a scholar.

GV: How do you attract learners? 
AG: By incorporating Wapishana reading and writing into friendly competitions at the district and regional levels of the annual Indigenous Heritage celebrations, we promote the idea that language literacy can be fun. 
And by translating Wapishana stories into English, we have paved the way for the possibility of the production of bilingual (diglot) booklets ... We're trying to design a special introductory course at the University of Guyana for non-Wapishana speaking students. 
My work at Leiden University has enabled me to build a network with other Indigenous scholars working on new methodologies ... 
The Ministry of Culture had asked for English translations of a number of our Wapishana stories ... The Amerindian Research Unit of the University of Guyana also approached us regarding an introductory course on the Wapishana language. 
I am regularly asked to give guest lectures and seminars there, and train students to embrace new methodologies in working with Indigenous peoples . 
GV: Have there been any efforts to integrate non-Wapishana speakers with those who do speak the language? 
AG: ... wo leaders of the Macushi, another Indigenous group, asked us to share our experiences to help them start their own local language literacy programmes. 
So, while the languages are distinctly different, groups might benefit from working on common strategies to teach our languages to our own peoples and also to non-Indigenous groups. ... 
Well-planned multilingual education places value on the national community. 
Being aware of differences does not equate to feeling estranged from those who are different; bilingual education can increase pride in diversity and strengthen national unity. 
If we weaken Indigenous culture, we weaken an integral part of Guyanese culture. 
GV: Does the remoteness of the Rupununi restrict your efforts? 
AG: One of the main constraints is a lack of internet access and telecommunications in most villages, including Maruranau, where the WWA centre is located. 
We are still waiting for mobile internet. 
An unreliable postal system in the Rupununi also hinders communication and prevents timely access to information. 
Adrian Gomes and his wife, who he says has supported him in his mission of reviving the Wapishana language.

GV: What do you make of linguist Noam Chomsky's theory that children only need to learn certain parochial features of their native language? 
AG: A similar view that places less importance on Indigenous language was revealed by Lightbown and Spada, who noted that most teachers working in Inuit Indigenous communities believed that the mother tongue is important mainly for use outside of school. 
This suggests that it’s not important in school and that for language preservation, external use of it would suffice ...There can be just as much lack of understanding with Wapishana parents and teachers; in fact, some are opposed to the bilingual pilot programme. 
In addressing this, I share the academic, cognitive and social benefits children have as a result of being literate both in their native and majority languages. 
Past bilingual education efforts in Wapishana communities have shown a significant improvement in children’s performance. 
With a more sustained programme, we can expect even greater levels of achievement. GV: Any plans for new projects? 
AG: ... 
Guyana will host an interpreting and translation workshop in the early part of next year, which other Indigenous organisations in both Guyana and Suriname have already signalled their interest in attending. 
We feel good about expanding our network; bringing communities with similar challenges together to look for solutions. 
Saraswathi's story. 
Image via Groundviews. 
This post, which contains a video by Selvaraja Rajasegar, originally appeared on Groundviews, an award-winning citizen journalism website in Sri Lanka. 
An edited version is published below as part of a content-sharing agreement with Global Voices. 
38-year-old Saraswathi wakes at 5:30 am to send her children to school before she heads to work. 
Saraswathi’s story highlights some of the challenges faced by the Malaiyaha (plantation) Tamil community, who have lived and worked in Sri Lanka for over 150 years. 
Parents often find it difficult to provide the meals required for children under the government’s stipulated school-feeding plan &#8212; the roti (bread) they eat regularly has almost no nutritional value, but is frequently the only thing they can afford. 
The Sri Lankan tea industry employs (directly or indirectly) over 1 million people. 
Many of the 500,000 tea estate workers are Tamils descended from cheap laborers brought to Sri Lanka from India by the British colonial rulers in the 19th century, and more than half of the workers are women. 
The tea estate workers have been calling for an increase in their daily basic wage to Rs. 
1000 (US$ 5.50) for years. 
700 (US$ 3.90). 
This has been met with widespread strikes by estate workers as well as solidarity protests in Colombo. 
Read: Sri Lankan tea estate workers take to the streets to demand fair wages 
1000 (US$ 5.50) per working day is impossible. 
Although Ceylon Tea is one of Sri Lanka’s top exports, the industry has suffered heavy losses for a number of reasons, including climate change. 
However, as Saraswathi’s story shows, the wages she earns are nowhere near enough to bear the costs of providing for her family, and increasingly, the younger generation of estate workers are forced to leave and look for work elsewhere.

Biryani Stories: Is Biryani the national dish of Pakistan? 
Biryani, one of the staples of Pakistani cuisine.

This is the first part of our series: "Biryani Stories" - a look at the common culinary culture in South Asian Countries. 
The king of South Asian cuisine and a loved-by-all dish is Biryani. 
The layered preparation, usually with fragrant basmati or kalizira rice, is sprinkled with saffron and has chunks of sumptuous meat. 
It is a very popular dish in Pakistan and the question often arises, "Is this the national dish of Pakistan"? 
Once a dish for royalty, today biryani reflects the flavor and traditions of each locality and is a common dish across many places in Pakistan. 
However, there is a controversy as to whether Biryani is the national dish of Pakistan. 
It seems that the Government of Pakistan has not declared any food to be the national dish because there isn't just one dish that is popular in every region and such a lavish meal is often out of reach for some Pakistanis. 
However, Biryani is definitely one of the strong contenders for the title. 
Biriyani has its origins among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent and is popular beyond the region. Well, Biryani is not just a food. 
Its an Emotion.. 
Best invention in the history of Mankind! 
! 
The word “biryani” comes from the Persian word “birian” which means “fried before cooking.” 
This South Asian mixed rice dish has its origins among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. 
It’s part of the Mughlai cuisine that India is famous for which was developed from the 15th century to about the 19th century during the reign of the Mughal empire. 
The Mughals raised cooking to an art form, introducing several recipes to India like biryani, pilaf, and kebabs. 
Biryani was first introduced by the Mughals in Northern India. 
It was known as pakka Biryani because most of the ingredients are pre-cooked and then assembled in a pot (deg) and then set on slow fire (dum) for final cooking. 
The deg is sealed and placed on slow fire until it is cooked to perfection.

Some of the regional flavors of Biryanis in Pakistan include Sindhi Biryani, Punjabi Biryani, Bohri biryani, Afghani Biryani, or the traditional Mughlai Biryani or Hyderabadi style Biryani. 
According to food critic Bisma Tirmizi, Sindhi Biryani is a Mughlai twist on the pulao, with a more fierce and exotic taste. 
There is another debate which is common in India and Pakistan regarding whether there should be Aloo (potato) in the Biryani or not. 
Some like the taste with or without potato. 
Earlier this year Manal Aijaz, a Pakistani blogger, posted a poll on social media. 
For the next 5 days, the Pakistani Twitter space was seen taking this poll seriously. 
Here is the result: 
And new ideas were floated: 
Idea: organise "A BIRYANI FESTIVAL" where there are stalls of every kind of biryani, with aloo, without aloo of chicken, beef and mutton. 
Which ever stall earns more wins. 
Ceasefire. — Tabinda (@TabindaTahiir) February 5, 2018 If you would like to have a taste some of the Pakistani Biryanis check out Faatimah's recipe for an easy and traditional Pakistani Chicken Biryani. 
You can also look at Ainy's recipe for Punjabi Biryani, Pakistani Lamb Biryani among others. 
For now, it seems the decision as to whether or not Biryani is the national dish of Pakistan is still undecided. 
Biryani Stories: In search of the origin of Biryani &middot; Global Voices

This is the second article of our series, “Biryani Stories”, which looks at the common culinary culture in South Asian countries. 
In this installment, we explore the various types of Biryani that exist in India. 
Read: Biryani Stories: Is Biryani the national dish of Pakistan? 
While a debate rages over whether Biryani, the king of South Asian cuisine, originated in Persia (present-day Iran), history suggests that this mixed rice dish has its origins among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent &#8212; part of the Mughlai cuisine for which India is famous. 
This does not discount the strong logic behind the claim that Biryani originated in Persia. 
The word comes from the Persian word “birian”, which means “fried before cooking” &#8212; but Iranian Biryani street food no longer contains rice; rather, it has evolved into chunks of meat cooked in an envelope of paper-thin bread. 
Of course, it is also possible that the food may have traveled with pilgrims from central Asia to the Deccan region in south India. 
The origin &amp; Journey Of Biryani http://t.co/xb6YsRApLk pic.twitter.com/80ez6oQjzI &mdash; Reddit India (@redditindia) August 7, 2014 
India is a diverse country in terms of culture and culinary flavors. 
Northern Indian food varieties, for example, have been influenced by the Mughlai cooking techniques like Dum Pukht (slow cooking in a sealed pot) and butter-based curries, while Southern Indian people are fonder of using more vegetables, rice, and seafood. 
North and Central Indian Biryanis 
One of the most famous Biryanis in India is Lucknowi Biryani, named after Lucknow, the capital of the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. 
In both flavor and aroma, it is considered one of the best Biryanis: the textures are softer and the spices milder. Biryani is part of the holy offering in this temple https://t.co/Y3iOt2ZBu1😍 #India #food &mdash; Manasi (@ManasiGopal) January 18, 2019 
Though social media users quibble about its origins, there is little doubt that Biryani is considered a trademark dish from the Indian subcontinent: 
There are at least 20 + varieties of biryani like Bombay biryani, Afghan biryani, Hyderabadi biryani, Sindhi biryani, Kacchi Biryani etc &amp; karachiites should realize that they did not invent it or own its rights. 
Its origin is Mughlai &amp; Awadhi cuisine from Delhi &amp; Lucknow. &mdash; Aaria🍃 (@Aariaa_) November 20, 2017 
Although Biryani may be a Persian import, the origin may go back to 2 A.D to a dish called 'Oon Soru', recorded in Sangam literature. 
A meat and rice preparation cooked with Black Pepper and Coriander and more. 
Could India's almost national dish have been invented in Tamilakam? 
The debate may go on, but no one will ever turn down a Biryiani treat. 
Digital journalist Luis Carlos Diaz is missing in Venezuela &middot; Global Voices 
"Where is Luis Carlos? 
" Image of the public online campaign shared by Provea. 
In the image they indicate the last time he had been contacted and the last time he tweeted. 
On the evening of March 11, political commentator Naky Soto and wife of Venezuelan journalist and media activist Luis Carlos Diaz tweeted that he had been missing for five hours. 
The Union of Press Workers (in Spanish, the SNTP) reported that Luis Carlos had been detained by the Bolivarian Intelligence Forces (SEBIN): 
URGENT A Sebin commission confirms that journalist Luis Carlos Díaz has been detained by that police organism. 
They pointed their weapons at journalist Marco Ruiz, Luz Mely Reyes and Federico Black. 
Hours before, Soto had tweeted that Luis Carlos Díaz had been missing for five hours: 
Dear everyone: I lost contact with @LuisCarlos at 5:30 this afternoon, when he told me he was coming home to rest because he was going to do a special broadcast at @Unionradionet from 10:00 pm to 5:00 am #DóndeEstáLuisCarlos 
@LuisCarlos is on his bike, but since 5:30 I've heard nothing from him and: 
- he's not at the radio station 
- he's not at home 
- he hasn't tweeted 
- he isn't answering calls 
- he isn't answering SMS or WhatsApp messages 
#DóndeEstáLuisCarlos 
As members of SEBIN searched Diaz's and Soto's home, Luz Mely Reyes reported live from the scene. 
The SNTP also reported the incident: 
URGENT At this time, 3:30 am, a commission from the Intelligence Forces arrives to journalist and human rights activist Luis Carlos Díaz's home, missing since 5:30 pm #WhereIsLuisCarlos 
Other human rights and freedom of speech organizations joined the campaign through #DondeEstaLuisCarlos (Where is Luis Carlos? ) which is, at the moment, a trending topic in Venezuela's twittosphere. 
Díaz is a journalist and a human rights and freedom of speech advocate who is well known and highly appreciated in Venezuela and abroad for his commentary and criticism of the government of Nicolas Maduro. 
He has long worked with Soto producing web-based video and radio programs focused on politics and human rights in Venezuela. 
He has also worked as an educator and promoter of the creation of citizen media spaces and independent media projects. 
Díaz has also been part of the Global Voices community for more than a decade. 
To me, Luis Carlos is a brilliant person, well versed in information and networks in this chaotic Venezuela of ours. 
He has been able to make links with society (from criticism to cultural spaces) #WhereIsLuisCarlos. 
The program's host, politician Diosdado Cabello, insinuated that Diaz had helped to orchestrate the nationwide power outage that had Venezuelans living in the dark for more than 24 hours on March 7 and 8. 
There is no evidence to support this. 
#DenounceEP Since 5:30 pm the whereabouts of journalist Luis Carlos Díaz are unknown. 
He was accused to be a "fascist-like influencer" through the Twitter account of "Con el mazo dando". 
Our friend @LuisCarlos is one of the most visible faces of dissident journalism in Venezuela. 
As time without solid information continues to pass, the SNTP joined the campaign that started the search at the headquarters of the Intelligence Service (SEBIN): 
It's been been seven hours since Luis Carlos Díaz has gone missing. is a journalist for Unión Radio Noticias and he's a human rights activist. 
We're at the SEBIN headquarters and they deny having him #WhereIsLuisCarlos 
Journalist Vladimir Villegas denounced that he had been detained by government forces: 
We've been informed that @Unionradionet journalist Luis Carlos Díaz, has been detained by State's security forces. 
We express our concern for his physical integrity. 
We demand any information of his whereabouts and respect for his human rights. 
The Global Voices community stands in solidarity with Luis Carlos, his family, and all other independent journalists working to hold power to account in Venezuela. 
We wish for his safe and speedy return, and will continue to update this story as it develops. 
Dijaawa Wotunnöi: an animated short film helps revitalise the Yekuana language &middot; Global Voices 
Dijaawa Wotunnöi is an ancestral myth of the Yekuana, an indigenous people who live in Venezuela and Brazil, that was turned into a short animated film by Saúl Kuyujani López. 
The film is completely spoken in Yekuana and has subtitles in Spanish. 
Several Yekuanas participated in the project as translators and researchers, and also contributed their voice to the film's characters. 
The author of this story was also part of the production team. 
The myth explains how the Yekuana people came to be descendants of bats. 
Part of the explanation lies with the life story of Kawashidi, a Yekuana man whose wife is killed by an evil spirit who then challenges him and tests his intelligence. 
Saúl Kuyujani López documented the myth as it's told in the community of Santa María de Erebato, located in the banks of the Caura river (Alto Caura) in the Bolivar state, Venezuela. 
According to Venezuela's 2011 census, there are 7,997 Yekuanas living in the states of Amazonas and Bolivar. 
Brazil's 2000 census registered around 430 Yekuanas living in the country. 
The UNESCO Interactive Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger classifies Yekuana as a vulnerable language. 
Yekuana teachers say that most parents do not consider important to pass on their language to future generations. 
Many take their children to cities so they can learn to speak Spanish well. 
As a result, children lose their family's language. 
For this reason, the animated adaptation of Dijaawa Wotunnöi aims to preserve the oral aspects of the Yekuana language through the audiovisual format. 
The film was produced by Creaser Creative Studio and supported by the Indigenous Organization of the Cayu Kuyujani Basin and the Humboldt Forum. 
The first screening took place at the Humboldt Forum in Berlin, Germany, in July 2017. 
The short film was selected in the official programme of the 13th International Film and Communication Festival of Indigenous / Native Peoples (FICMAYAB), which was held in Guatemala in October 2018. 
The national premiere was held at the Indigenous Film Festival of Venezuela, in November 2018.

Cote d'Ivoire's chocolate waste spurs second industry in cocoa butter &middot; Global Voices 
Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. 
An Ivorian woman melts chocolate waste to produce cocoa butter. 
Photo used with author's permission. 
Editor's note: Dr. Jeslyn Lemke traveled to Cote d'Ivoire in December 2018 and learned about the process of cocoa butter production using chocolate waste. 
Lemke produced a short video explaining the process exclusively for Global Voices. 
Forty-five-year-old Fatima Traoré, a mother of eight, sells her cocoa butter to soap makers every few months. 
Traoré lives in Cote d'Ivoire, the world’s largest producer of cocoa beans. 
Major European companies buy cocoa beans or cocoa bean paste from Cote d'Ivoire cocoa factories to produce chocolate. 
But Ivorians also have a local use for the oily bean: rendering cocoa butter from the chocolate scraps from the chocolate factories, to make a local soap, Kabakrou. 
Traoré, who lives in the major metropolitan city of Abidjan, buys several tons of chocolate scraps every few months from a chocolate factory in Youpogon, a neighborhood of Abidjan. 
Screen capture of selling her cocoa butter (from the original video) with the author's permission 
The factories have sold the majority of the cocoa paste to companies in Europe and discard the plastic bags which stored the chocolate. 
In December 2018, Lemke narrated and shot this video to explain the entire process, with an in-depth interview with Traoré. 
The cocoa butter is a sought-after commodity in the region. 
The original Kabakrou soap is a hard, ball-shaped soap usually made from palm oil and caustic soda mixed with water.

The soap can be sold in bulk or on a per unit-basis in several cities of Côte d'Ivoire as well as in neighboring countries of Mali and Burkina Faso. 
Traoré's cocoa-based soap is an intriguing alternative to the more standard palm-oil based Kabakrou soap. In India, a video brings awareness to children suffering from mumps &middot; Global Voices 
This post was written by Grace Jolliffe and originally appeared on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organisation based in India. 
An edited version is published below as part of a content-sharing agreement. 
Mumps, a highly contagious viral disease, continues to spread unabatedly in India, mainly because the widely available vaccine is not included in the free Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) of India. 
Video Volunteer Community Correspondent Shabnam Begum produced a video reporting the outbreak of illness at a primary school in Danganj Bidur village, Varanasi which brought widespread attention to the problem. 
Shabnam, formerly a teacher, hails from Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh. 
Here is her video: 
“When we looked at the attendance roster, we realised that many children were absent. 
We found that the children had mumps,” says Ramchand, a teacher at the primary school. 
According to the WHO, mumps is an infection caused by a virus and spread human-to-human via direct contact or by airborne droplets. 
It is a mild childhood disease, most often affecting children between five and nine years old. 
However, the mumps virus can infect adults as well, and when it does, possible complications are more likely to be serious. 
Complications of mumps can include meningitis (in up to 15% of cases), orchitis and deafness. 
Very rarely, mumps can cause encephalitis and permanent neurological damage. 
Vaccines to prevent the diseases have been available since the 1960s and globally, 120 countries have included the mumps vaccine in their national immunisation schedule. 
India, however, is yet to follow suit. 
After Shabnam produced the above video highlighting the outbreak of the disease, she screened it to the doctors at Cholapur Community Health Centre at Cholapur block in Varanasi. 
The doctors then visited the school where all the students underwent a thorough check-up and were given medication. 
“The team of doctors continued their visits until all the children recovered. 
It took approximately one month for all the children to get better,” says Ramchand. 
Shabnam who works on health, education, sanitation, and gender says that she would like to continue using her camera as a tool to amplify the voices of marginalised members of her community. 
And to continue to create awareness and mobilise her community. 
Insights into Kashmir's crisis from a Kashmiri born in Nepal &middot; Global Voices 
A Kashmiri man holds pieces of 120mm mortar rounds. 
He stands on the rooftop of his house which was destroyed by a mortar shell. 
Armies from both India and Pakistan have been exchanging fire on the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir following the abrogation of Article 370 by the Indian authorities.

On 5 August 2019, the Indian government issued a constitutional order repealing Article 370 - a move which revoked the special status given to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. 
Read our Special Coverage: Indian Kashmir's crisis 
India's neighbor, Nepal, is one of the many countries that doesn't support third-party intervention and, as reported by ANI, Nepal’s Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali said it was an internal matter for the Indian state. 
While there have been demonstrations in Nepal’s capital city Kathmandu to resolve the Kashmir issue through dialogue, some Nepali-speaking Gorkhas living in Jammu celebrated the Indian Government’s decision. 
Aquib is a graduate of Kashmir University living in Nepal's capital, Kathmandu. 
He was born in Nepal to a Nepali mother and owns a jewellery shop in Kathmandu. 
He spoke with GV to get his opinion about India's decision to revoke Article 370. 
Global Voices (GV): How long have you been living in Nepal? 
Aquib (A): I was born in Nepal. 
My father came to Nepal to start a business in the 1980s. 
My father is a Kashmiri and my mother a Nepali. 
Apart from spending some years in Kashmir during my studies, I’ve been living mostly in Nepal. 
GV: What is your emotional connection with Kashmir? 
A: I completed my Bachelor’s degree from Kashmir University. 
My relatives and friends live in Kashmir. 
Currently, my parents also live in Kashmir. 
I visit Kashmir 3-4 times every year. 
Last I went there on 8 August 2019. 
Before I got there, the Government of India had decided to revoke the special status of the State of Jammu and Kashmir. 
Global Voices (GV): In your opinion, why is Jammu &amp; Kashmir contested? 
A: Kashmir has been in debates since 1947 when India and Pakistan were divided. 
Both India and Pakistan have been neglecting the self-decision rights of Kashmir. 
Kashmir got entangled in the conflict. 
Recently, after India encroached on their rights, the conflict rose sharply. 
GV: What significance did Article 370 have for Kashmiris? 
A: Article 370 of the Indian constitution holds a special significance for Jammu and Kashmir. 
Because of it, Jammu Kashmir was free to have its own constitution, flag and laws. 
The Kashmiris have lost their identity and rights after the abrogation of the Article which gave Jammu Kashmir a ‘Special State’ status. 
GV: Why do you think the Government of India repealed Article 370? 
Aquib: India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) he is leading had been trying to repeal Article 370. 
This was their political motive and they had mentioned it in their election manifesto as well. 
And only a few months after winning the Lok Sabha elections they have hurt the sentiments and snatched the rights of Kashmiri people by repealing Article 370. 
GV: While Nepal has stated that the Kashmir issue is India’s internal matter, how are Nepalis treating the Kashmiris living in Nepal? 
Aquib: More than 500 Kashmiris live in Nepal’s capital city Kathmandu and touristic city Pokhara doing business. 
We Kashmiris have neither been discriminated nor been treated badly by the Nepali community. 
In contrast, we are treated with suspicion in India. 
At the airport immigration, we are hassled by questions like "why we are going to Nepal? " and "for how long? ", etc. 
GV: How do you find the news on Kashmir issue disseminated by the Nepali media – is it against Kashmiris or unbiased? 
A: The news about the Kashmir issue disseminated by Nepali media is not biased against anybody, but it is about the latest move by the Indian Government and Article 370. 
India’s move is ill-considered and one-sided. 
This decision might lead to more trouble instead of solving the dispute. 
I appeal to the international community to stand in solidarity with the Kashmiris against the injustice meted out to them. 
GV: How will repealing Article 370 affect Kashmir in the future? 
A: The special rights Jammu and Kashmir had been exercising for the last seven decades have been removed. 
To muzzle the Kashmiri voices against this move armed forces have been sent to Kashmir. 
Communication services like mobile phones and the internet have been shut down including educational institutions.

The Indigenous Tharu People of Nepal Risk Losing Their Once-Mandatory Art of Tattooing &middot; Global Voices 
Kalarvati Chaudhary, 61, remembers her younger days when talking about the tattoos of betel nut palm, peacock and other motifs inspired by nature on her body.

Used with permission. 
For centuries, tattooing has been an integral part of life for the indigenous Tharu people living in the southern plains of Nepal. 
Now, as the Tharu people face modernization, the tattooing practice is losing its importance among younger generations. 
Tharu women wear tattoos on their arms, legs, and chests as a beautification practice. 
The tattoos, called khodna and godna in the Tharu language, are inspired by nature. 
The most common tattoo motifs are lines, dots, crosses and other various natural elements. 
I saw this beautiful woman walking along the #dagar (village road). 
I stopped her and praised her tattoo. 
She gave me thanks and I requested her for photo. 
She agreed. 
I took her photo. 
This pattern of tattoos #khodaha #godana are found in Eastern Tharu Community. 
But I forgot asking the name of such patterns. 
Today I have been to Dumariya, Sunsari (Ramdhuni Municipality/ ward#1). 
I met some beautiful Tharu women. 
I requested with them to contribute giving their pictures with tattoo. 
Locally the tattoo is called #khodaha or #godana. 
In the seen picture, this pattern of the khodaha is called #surujkedaali (the rising sun)! 
Traditionally, young women could decide to wear tattoos as permanent jewelry, whereas all married women must have compulsory tattoos on their legs applied prior to marrying, typically in the month of March during the wedding season (the months of Falgun-Chaitra in the Bikram Sambat calendar). 
Today, however, neither the married nor the young Tharu girls choose to wear tattoos. 
In ‘Tatooing Among the Tharus of Dang Deokhuri, Far Western Nepal’ a paper published in 1975, researcher D.P. Rajaure captures the aesthetic essence of tattooing among the Tharu: 
The main reason for tattooing among these Tharus is aesthetic. 
According to them, young and unmarried girls do not need and hence do not have to decorate themselves by tattooing because their bright and colourful cholyas (a kind of blouse with its opening in the back) are beautiful and decorative; but a married woman has to get herself tattooed to compensate for the lack of beauty or decoration brought about by donning jhulwa or dainaha jhulwa, a kind of ladies’ shirt with full sleeves, double-breasted and opening in the front. 
The tattoos on the lower part of the legs generally represent sitha (stick or straw), chulha (stove) and phunna (hanging motifs), whereas tattoos on the middle part represent majur (peacock) and sithas in between and tattoos on the top part of the legs represent a single peacock in the centre and some phunna or other motifs on three sides of it, making a frame for a single peacock at the centre. 
Tikaniya (tattooers in Tharu) used tattooing needles and natural black ink obtained from the soot of a mustard lamp. 
After drying, mustard oil was applied to soften the surface of the skin. 
The tikaniya then marked the designs and pricked the skin with tattooing needles. 
One Tharu elder from Chitwan, Nepal recollects: 
In the old days, when girls of my age were young, a man from India would come and do these tattoos in our bodies. 
That night I couldn't sleep. 
The next day I asked my mother why I had to get the tattoo. 
She said, 'Who will marry a girl without a tattoo? 
No one will take you unless you have them.' 
&#34;In the old days, when girls of my age were young, a man from India would come and do these tattoos in our bodies. 
When my friend was being pierced, I could see tears in her eyes because of the pain and I remember being afraid as I was next. That night I couldn't sleep. The next day I asked my mother why I had to get the tattoo. 
She said, &#34;Who will marry a girl without a tattoo? 
No one will take you unless you have them.&#34; I never understood that. 
Later I also learnt that in our culture tattoos were also a worship to nature. 
We don't take anything with us when we die, but I will take these tattoos. 
It is like a gift of this life and this nature for me to take to my afterlife.&#34; (Thagani Mahato, Meghauli, Chitwan) 
Aside from beautification, another key reason Tharu women tattooed themselves was to avoid the attention of The Royal Nepalese, who hated tattoos associated with tribal and indigenous peoples. Tharu tattoos prevented nobles from abducting and keeping them as sex slaves. Can you see tattoos all over this lady's body and arms? 
Kanni Devi Tharuni from Saptari says, &#34;It was the cheapest way to adorn oneself with unerasable jewellery.&#34; The Tharus in southern plains of Nepal had a rich culture of getting tattos on their bodies but due to modernisation this practice has been on decline. 
In fact, the youngsters don't get tattoed at all. 
Getting tattoed was compulsory for married Tharu women in the past. 
She says, &#34;This tattoo will go with me when I die.&#34; &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; #tattoo #tharus #terai #Nepal #culture #tradition #marriedwomen #tattoing #inking #instapic 
Despite a rich tattooing history, Tharu youngsters do not get tattooed. 
Experienced tikaniyas are no longer found in the villages and younger generations have not yet come forward to steer this age-old tradition. 
Highly complex traditional pattern on the legs and arms of this Tharu lady from Chitwan, Nepal. 
Life in the villages of the Tharu communities in southern Nepal hasn't changed that much. 
Study of Tharu female tattoos from southern Nepal.

Perhaps as young Tharu are reintroduced to the art of tattooing via social media, incorporating new colors, designs and patterns inspired by traditional designs may reignite this age-old tradition.

Testing the limits of LGBT acceptance in Taiwan: Interview with filmmaker Ming Lang Chen &middot; Global Voices 
A scene from the movie The Teacher featuring the main character Kevin and his mother. 
Photo provided by Swallow wings films, used with permission. 
A recently released and already awarded Taiwanese movie tests the limits of acceptance of LGBT people as the country became the first in Asia to pass a marriage-equality law in May 2019. 
Chen spends most of his time in New York but travels regularly to Taiwan. 
Chen agreed to an interview as he tours Taiwan for the premiere of The Teacher. 
Filip Noubel: What inspired you to make the movie The Teacher（我的靈魂是愛做的）？ 
Ming Lang Chen: My initial idea was to make a movie about a gay couple in which one is HIV positive, and the other isn't. 
Eventually, the story evolved, and I decided to make the movie in Taiwan. 
The main plot follows Kevin, a 26-year-old high school teacher who teaches civic education in Taiwan. 
He falls in love with another man, and discovers two things about him later: That this man is married to a woman and that he is HIV positive. 
Kevin is thus faced with a number of challenges: He has to face his own mother with whom he still lives and with whom he talks about the man he loves; then there is the fear of AIDS, and finally he also needs to face his lover's wife. 
On top of that, someone spreads a rumor at his school that he is HIV positive. 
The school then tries to force him to resign, as it is illegal to fire someone based on their HIV status in Taiwan. 
So the main theme is really how one faces pressure at a rather young age. 
The Teacher is about human communication, it shows a wide range of delicate emotions, I wouldn't say it is just a gay movie. 
FN: Why do you think your movie won an award at the 2019 Gold Horse Award? 
MLC: Taiwan is very friendly towards LGBT film production. 
Every year the the Golden Horse Award, which started in 1962, has at least one or two LGBT-themed movies competing for an award. 
In 1993, the gay-themed movie Wedding Banquet by Taiwanese and now global filmmaker Ang Lee won the award for best feature film. 
In 2003, a serial adaptation of Crystal Boys (孽子), inspired the groundbreaking gay novel of the same name by Taiwanese gay author Pai Hsien-yung (白先勇) won the Golden Bell Awards. 
As for Winnie Chang, who plays the wife in my film, I believe she won the Best Supporting Actress Award because, even though there are very few scenes involving her, she represents the many layers of this typical situation when gay men marry women out of social and family pressure. 
She finds herself in a love triangle that was not her choice and is exposed to a lot of pressure. 
She married into a big family, has to keep up appearances, wants a child and is pressured by her in-laws to do so. 
Yet she remains tolerant and humane.

FN: Taiwan is often described as an oasis for LGBT rights in East Asia. 
Is this true and does it apply to all parts of Taiwanese society? 
MLC: In the capital Taipei, we live in a very open space, we have a large Gay Pride Parade, and so we tend to think that being gay is no big deal. 
But we need to get outside of this bubble and see what is really happening in society. 
Because yes, Taiwan is a democracy, but a very young one, just in its early 30s. 
This is why I chose a main character who is just under 30. 
I wanted to see what this generation is experiencing, as they are the first to grow in a post-martial law society. 
This is why the movie will be distributed across Taiwan in 16 commercial movie theaters. 
We didn't want to go big and end up with half-empty movie theater rooms. 
This is an art movie, quite different from Taiwanese mainstream movies that are heavily influenced by the storytelling of TV series. 
Our hope is that word of mouth will convince audiences who are into indie movies to come and appreciate The Teacher. 
Filmmaker Ming Lang Chen (on the right) at the premiere of The Teacher in Taoyuan, with a fan and the main actor Oscar Chiu (邱志宇) (on the left).

FN: Who then is opposing LGBT rights in Taiwan today? 
MLC: The strongest opposition comes from certain members of religious groups, and mostly Christian people. 
They have money, are influenced by groups outside of Taiwan, and have a blind belief that homosexuality is wrong, even though the Bible doesn't say that. 
But there is also another factor: our Asian traditions that keep any talk about homosexuality hush hush. 
The result is that very few people come out, so people don’t get to see or know a gay person in their immediate circles.That's what I wanted to achieve with Kevin; to introduce a person who looks like a neighbour so people can look at his dilemma and say: “I know him! 
". 
I couldn't imagine that I would see marriage-equality happen in Taiwan, and we have to thank people like Chi Chia-wei who were brave enough to come out publicly. 
I never felt prouder to be a Taiwanese than the day we passed the marriage equality law. 
Hong Kong protest artwork: Yellow Objects &middot; Global Voices 
Cropped from the "Yellow Object" exhibit.

Street posters and graffiti have been an essential component of the prolonged anti-government protests in Hong Kong. 
This month, a group of 18 designers has a joint exhibition titled “Yellow Objects”. 
The exhibition shows 18 posters following the theme “yellow object is ______” and it provides a maker space for participants to draw their own version of “yellow and black” street posters to display in the exhibition space.

Inspired by this emerging, painfully beautiful cityscape, 18 graphic designers speak up with the language of visual arts, in the format of poster in yellow and black. 
The exhibition “ YELLOW OBJECTS” is a mockery of the brutal and ruthless authority that refers human being as object, and a reminder to defend and uphold human dignity. 
We hope that the audience could bring the message back to their community, by putting up these posters in their neighbourhood. 
It will be a perfect demonstration of our outcry for freedom, that will not be silenced by violence. 
"Protect our kids".

Astrophysicists in Ethiopia hop on 'astrobus' tour of cosmic possibilities &middot; Global Voices 
Astrobus Ethiopia 2019 will launch its cosmic tour in northern Ethiopia, just ahead of Ethiopia's first-ever satellite launch in December 2019.

Ethiopian officials say they will launch their first satellite into space this month. 
In the week leading up to the historic launch, a team of 24 astrophysicists, scientists, artists, and innovators will hop on "Astrobus Ethiopia" and tour eight cities in northern Ethiopia offering hands-on workshops in science and the arts. 
Departing from Addis Ababa on December 7, the group will connect with over 1,000 high school students per city at venues arranged by local universities to teach a range of workshops that encourage abstract and critical thinking. 
In total, they intend to reach over 8,000 students and spark their curiosity. 
"The main idea here is to deliver scientific and abstract ideas that are accessible and relevant to our everyday lives, and to make connections in new and exciting ways," Nebiha Shafi told Global Voices in a video call. 
An astronomer from Ethiopia, Shafi currently works in South Africa and studies galaxy evolution. 
But her heart is also in public outreach — especially to encourage more girls and women to get into science.

Shafi, along with cosmologist Yabebal Tadesse, who works in Germany as a freelance data scientist, have been part of Astrobus Ethiopia since its debut in 2017. 
Tadesse, who explores "the universe using the cosmic microwave background data," said the idea for Astrobus Ethiopia struck him when he saw a photo on Facebook of the "Astro Truck," an astronomy outreach project in Senegal. 
Tadesse called Shafi right away and proposed the idea of doing something similar, but expanded the scope to include arts and innovation in addition to astronomy outreach. 
The two, together with their colleagues, immediately began to imagine the design of the project and answered a call from Astronomy for Development — a branch of the International Astronomy Union (IAU) — for funding. 
"We talked to our friends, our colleagues, and everybody was excited, especially by the combination of innovation and art — it's not just science," Shafi said. 
It would take two years, however, to get the project off the ground, due to the political instability in Ethiopia between 2015-2017. 
"The stability situation at that time was a concern, with lots of demonstrations happening in the regions we planned to pass through, so we had to wait some time, and on top, we also wanted a partner inside , because most of us were outside at that time, to with logistics," Tadesse said in a video call with Global Voices. 
The two gathered a production team and partnered with the Ethiopian Space Science Society, the first of its kind in Ethiopia. 
The ESS established the first East African Entoto Observatory and Research Center, and, as a member of the IAU, they were the perfect partner for Astrobus Ethiopia. 
Most of the Astrobus team members also work with the Ethiopian Space Science Technology Institute, whose motto is, "We explore the Universe for the benefit of our people! " 
Astrobus Ethiopia 2019 
The Astrobus Ethiopia 2019 tour will mirror a lot of the same goals as the inaugural 2017 version in Ethiopia. 
The group of 24 artists, scientists, innovators and storytellers will bring young people together to learn about the stars, planets, galaxies and cosmos, but also about storytelling, photography, music, film, agriculture, and fashion. 
The team produces educational materials in three main local languages: Amharic, Oromo and Tigrina. 
Astrobus Ethiopia has produced learning materials on astronomy and astrophysics in local languages such as Amharic and Oromo. 
During the 9-day tour, students from at least 10 different high schools will gather at local university venues to learn, connect, and engage with new ideas. 
While many on the team are astrophysicists and cosmologists, Shafi and Tadesse said that their mission is more about critical and creative thinking than anything else. 
Astrobus leaders will teach students how to approach challenges head-on, the way most innovators work in their respective fields — whether it's design, fashion, poetry, engineering, astronomy or the arts. 
Tadesse explained the importance of learning the "vocabularies of the challenge," to understand and interpret, combine and compose, to create new ideas and solutions. 
"We need to learn how to transfer knowledge, and transfer of knowledge requires abstract thinking" to solve problems, Shafi said. 
For many students, this will be their first time holding a telescope or using drones or binoculars to study the universe. 
To get more equipment into the hands of curious young people, Astrobus Ethiopia has launched a fundraising campaign.

Historic space science advancements 
The group will wind their way back to Addis Ababa, the capital, just in time for Ethiopia's historic launch of the satellite into space, which has been announced for December 17, in Addis Ababa. 
The team plans to be there to celebrate Astrobus' achievements as well as Ethiopia's national advancements in space science and technology. 
"We want to tap into that, how by thinking slightly different, we sometimes can improve the system," Tadesse said, adding that Ethiopia's latest advancements in space science and technology should be highlighted more. 
For example, this year's Nobel Prize in physics went to the discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a star, and the IAU asked Ethiopia to name one. 
"Whatever we see happening in the country, not just nationally, but internationally, we're saying everything starts from something — a single idea that then gets transformed," Shafi said. 
"Nothing is too big and there's no idea which we call small." 
For the first time, clouded leopards have been found high up in Nepal's Himalayas. 
But can they survive climate change?

Clouded leopards, one of the most elusive cats, were found for the first time at an altitude of 3498 meters (11476 feet) above sea level in the Langtang National Park in Nepal. 
The study, led by Özgün Emre Can from the University of Oxford, confirmed the existence of this cat species in this high altitude. 
(3/4) We discovered clouded leopards at 3500 m a.s.l. in Langtang National Park, Nepal. 
The species wasn’t known to exist in this region of the Himalayas. 
In the research study published by Can and his colleagues, the authors state: 
Before this study, there was no hard evidence that clouded leopards occurred above 2300 meters above sea level, having documented them at almost 4000 meters above sea level in the Himalayas, we emphasise the importance of this extreme portion of the species’ range where climate is likely to change more rapidly and with greater consequences, than the global average. 
Named after its cloud-like blotched pattern on the skin, the clouded leopard is found in the Nepali Himalayas in the west to southern China in the north and east, and Peninsular Malaysia in the south. 
It has been listed as a vulnerable species in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. 
Estimates say there are around 100 clouded leopards in Nepal and they were believed to be extinct in the country until 1987. 
Apart from the Langtang National Park, there have been reported sightings in the Annapurna Conservation Area, Chitwan National Park, Kanchenjunga Conservation Area, Makalu-Barun, Rara and Shivapuri Nagarjun National Parks. 
Achievement in wildlife conservation: Nepal is listed in Top 5 country for conservation of Clouded Leopard by European Outdoor Conservation Association 😮🇳🇵 
Largely nocturnal, clouded leopards are great climbers which has earned them the moniker “tree tigers”. 
The National Park and Wildlife Conservation Act 1973 has given special protection to clouded leopard in Nepal. 
According to the Act, any person illegally killing or injuring, selling, purchasing or transferring or obtaining a clouded leopard shall be punished with a fine ranging from fifty to one hundred thousand rupees or imprisonment ranging from five years to fifteen years or both. 
But this has not stopped poachers – four clouded leopard pelts were found by Nepal Police in 2018 within a span of two months. 
Clouded leopards are poached for their beautiful pelts that are traded illegally while the habitat loss and degradation remain the prime concerns for their conservation. 
In addition, these leopards found at high altitudes face the threat of warming temperatures that are pushing other highland species towards higher elevations. 
In the Eastern Himalayan region, the annual mean temperatures are projected to increase research on average by 2.9 degrees Celsius by the middle of the century. 
According to researchers, even if global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, the high mountains are likely to warm even more.

However, the study found that Langtang National Park has abundant prey species like red muntjac, wild boar, Himalayan serow, Himalayan goral, musk deer, Nepal grey langur, Assam macaque, and Malayan porcupine for both clouded and common leopards. 
Technologies like camera-trapping have been helping scientists study the dynamics and behaviour of this species. 
In addition, captive breeding and artificial insemination techniques are projected to further help save these leopards. 
The presence of the Nepali army and park administration working together to protect the park and curb illegal wildlife trade gives hope for the conservation of these leopards in the high altitude. 
On Twitter, this Brazilian writer illuminates stories from black history &middot; Global Voices 
Ale Santos, researcher and writer.

There is a tree that grows in Africa, the Middle-East, and Australia called baobab (adansonia). 
Some African peoples used to believe that if you walked around it, you would forget something about your life. 
Before forcing captured people into their ships, slavers would force them to walk in circles around the tree of oblivion so that they'd leave their culture and lives behind. 
Brazilian writer Ale Santos tells that anecdote in the preface of his book Rastros da Resistência ("trails of resistance," in Portuguese), a collection of 20 stories about real-life black heroes, published in October in Brazil. 
Despite European efforts to erase the identities and roots of the people enslaved, Santos says in the book, an oral tradition kept the history of Africa and its diaspora alive; stories such as that of the baobab are now crucial to reimagine cultural realms once considered lost. 
He writes: 
In Western Africa, there were the griots (or djéli, in French), guardians of the oral tradition. 
They had a prominent position and sometimes also performed other jobs, such as messengers, heralds, war councillors, artisans. 
But, most importantly, they were the living record of the main events of their people. 
The book was the result of a year and a half of research and models Santos' Twitter account, @savagefiction, which is well-known in Brazil for its threads on Africa and its diaspora's history. 
Santos first began to narrate those historical events on WhatsApp, in small groups with his friends. 
In June 2018, he decided to move the storytelling to Twitter. 
A thread about the genocide of 8-10 million people in present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo between the late 19th and the early 20th century, perpetrated by Leopold II of Belgium, was Santos' first thread to go viral: 
There is so much historical injustice against the African people, to consider the Jewish Holocaust as the greatest crime against humanity is a mistake. 
Leopold II was a far bloodthirstier monster. 
This is a sad thread, but necessary, to those who still don't know the Congo's holocaust. 
Santos then realized that stories were a powerful weapon of knowledge. 
After the King Leopold's thread, he wrote about human zoos, where natives from regions colonized by Europe were displayed like animals: 
Europeans must be enthusiastic about the lack of historical memory in colonized countries. 
This thread is for those who don't know about the inhumane racist zoos that existed around the world. 
Santos mainly focuses on little-known Brazilian historical figures, such as Dragão do Mar ("dragon of the sea"), a leader of raft workers who stopped the slave trade in the northeastern state of Ceará, and Tereza de Benguela, queen of a quilombo (settlements from the colonial times, whose inhabitants were, mostly, people who had escaped slavery); one time, he wrote about the politics of population whitening in early 20th century Brazil, or events such as the mass killing of 111 inmates in a São Paulo prison in 1992. 
Many people don't know, but Brazil has stories of abolitionists that would make any black person shiver and light a proud ancestral flame for our struggle. 
I'll tell one of them on this thread, about a fearless warrior known as a mythological beast: Dragão do Mar (dragon of the sea) 
In 2003, a law made African-Brazilian History and Culture a mandatory subject on the national curriculum. 
Sixteen years on, it’s not yet implemented on all schools, usually depending on isolated individual initiatives. 
As Santos told Global Voices via WhatsApp, there is an unfortunate tradition of recounting history from the perspective of the colonizers. 
Eurocentrism left deep scars in every country that went through colonization, which stole their diversity and culture were stolen, he says. 
To tell the stories that exist marginally to historiography is to give those people a new dignity, reestablish their importance, in a democratic movement, an environment where everyone feels appreciated. 
Really, that impacts the individual. 
It impacts the way society sees that individual, free of stereotypes, acknowledging their ancestry, their cultural value within the society, in any democracy. 
Santos also received praise from Brazilian rapper Emicida. 
Writing for on the book's dust jacket, the rapper compares the erasure of black identity and tradition by the slavery system with walking around with only your shadow to look at, without any reflection in the mirror. 
Structural racism takes aim at non-white bodies, the culture targets our imaginary. 
It is there where it tries to knock you out before you can even step into the ring. 
In a joint effort, they both try to ensure that René Descartes’ sentence &#8212; “I think, therefore I am” &#8212; doesn't make any sense to you. 
Human beings invented who they are thanks to the ability of shaping the imaginary of our equals through stories.
