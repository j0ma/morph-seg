Examples
After pressing Ctrl+Alt+I, the KSIRC window will be activated, if it exists. Simple.

KSIRC
After pressing Alt+Ctrl+H the input of'Hello 'will be simulated, as if you typed it. This is especially useful if you have call to frequently type a word (for instance, 'unsigned'). Every keypress in the input is separated by a colon ':'. Note that the keypresses literally mean keypresses, so you have to write what you would press on the keyboard. In the table below, the left column shows the input and the right column shows what to type.\\ "enter" (i. e. new line) Enter or Return\ a (i. e. small a) A\ A (i. e. capital a) Shift+A\: (colon) Shift+;\ '' (space) Space
Type'Hello '
This action runs Konsole, after pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.
Run Konsole
Read the comment on the "Type'Hello '" action first.\\ Qt Designer uses Ctrl+F4 for closing windows. In KDE, however, Ctrl+F4 is the shortcut for going to virtual desktop 4, so this shortcut does not work in QT Designer. Further, Qt Designer does not use KDE's standard Ctrl+W for closing the window.\\ This problem can be solved by remapping Ctrl+W to Ctrl+F4 when the active window is Qt Designer. When Qt Designer is active, every time Ctrl+W is pressed, Ctrl+F4 will be sent to Qt Designer instead. In other applications, the effect of Ctrl+W is unchanged.\\ We now need to specify three things: A new shortcut trigger on'Ctrl+W', a new keyboard input action sending Ctrl+F4, and a new condition that the active window is Qt Designer.\ Qt Designer seems to always have title'Qt Designer by Trolltech ', so the condition will check for the active window having that title.
Remap Ctrl+W to Ctrl+F4 in Qt Designer
By pressing Alt+Ctrl+W a D-Bus call will be performed that will show the minicli. You can use any kind of D-Bus call, just like using the command line'qdbus' tool.
Perform D-Bus call'kdesktop KDesktopIface popupExecuteCommand() '
Read the comment on the "Type'Hello '" action first.\\ Just like the "Type'Hello'" action, this one simulates keyboard input, specifically, after pressing Ctrl+Alt+B, it sends B to XMMS (B in XMMS jumps to the next song). The'Send to specific window 'checkbox is checked and a window with its class containing'XMMS_Player' is specified; this will make the input always be sent to this window. This way, you can control XMMS even if, for instance, it is on a different virtual desktop.\\ (Run'xprop 'and click on the XMMS window and search for WM_CLASS to see'XMMS_Player').
Next in XMMS
XMMS window
XMMS Player window
Konqueror in KDE3.1 has tabs, and now you can also have gestures.\\ Just press the middle mouse button and start drawing one of the gestures, and after you are finished, release the mouse button. If you only need to paste the selection, it still works, just click the middle mouse button. (You can change the mouse button to use in the global settings).\\ Right now, there are the following gestures available:\ move right and back left - Forward (Alt+Right)\ move left and back right - Back (Alt+Left)\ move up and back down - Up (Alt+Up)\ circle anticlockwise - Reload (F5)\\ The gesture shapes can be entered by performing them in the configuration dialog. You can also look at your numeric pad to help you: gestures are recognized like a 3x3 grid of fields, numbered 1 to 9.\\ Note that you must perform exactly the gesture to trigger the action. Because of this, it is possible to enter more gestures for the action. You should try to avoid complicated gestures where you change the direction of mouse movement more than once. For instance, 45654 or 74123 are simple to perform, but 1236987 may be already quite difficult.\\ The conditions for all gestures are defined in this group. All these gestures are active only if the active window is Konqueror (class contains'konqueror ').

About Bug Reporting - Help
Information about bug reporting
You can help us improve this software by filing a bug report.
It is safe to close this dialog. If you do not want to, you do not have to file a bug report.
In order to generate a useful bug report we need some information about both the crash and your system. (You may also need to install some debug packages.)
Bug Reporting Assistant Guide
This assistant will guide you through the crash reporting process for the KDE Bug Reports Database Site. All the information you enter on the bug report must be in English, if possible, as KDE is formed internationally.
What do you know about the crash?
In this page you need to describe how much do you know about the desktop and the application state before it crashed.
If you can, describe in as much detail as possible the crash circumstances, and what you were doing when the application crashed (this information is going to be requested later.) You can mention:
actions you were taking inside or outside the application
documents or images that you were using and their type/ format (later if you go to look at the report in the bug tracking system, you can attach a file to the report)
widgets that you were running
the URL of a web site you were browsing
configuration details of the application
or other strange things you notice before or after the crash.
Screenshots can be very helpful sometimes. You can attach them to the bug report after it is posted to the bug tracking system.
Crash Information (backtrace)
This page will generate a "backtrace" of the crash. This is information that tells the developers where the application crashed.
If the crash information is not detailed enough, you may need to install some debug packages and reload it (if the Install Debug Symbols button is available you can use it to automatically install the missing information.)
You can find more information about backtraces, what they mean, and how they are useful at %1
Once you get a useful backtrace (or if you do not want to install the missing debugging packages) you can continue.
Conclusions
Using the quality of the crash information gathered, and your answers on the previous page, the assistant will tell you if the crash is worth reporting or not.
If the crash is worth reporting but the application is not supported in the KDE bug tracking system, you will need to directly contact the maintainer of the application.
If the crash is listed as being not worth reporting, and you think the assistant has made a mistake, you can still manually report the bug by logging into the bug tracking system. You can also go back and change information and download debug packages.
Login into the bug tracking system
We may need to contact you in the future to ask for further information. As we need to keep track of the bug reports, you need to have an account on the KDE bug tracking system. If you do not have one, you can create one here: %1
Then, enter your username and password and press the Login button. You can use this login to directly access the KDE bug tracking system later.
The KWallet dialog may appear when pressing Login to save your password in the KWallet password system. Also, it will prompt you for the KWallet password upon loading to autocomplete the login fields if you use this assistant again.
List of possible duplicate reports
This page will search the bug report database for similar crashes which are possible duplicates of your bug. If there are similar bug reports found, you can double click on them to see details. Then, read the current bug report information so you can check to see if they are similar.
If you are very sure your bug is the same as another that is previously reported, you can set your information to be attached to the existing report.
If you are unsure whether your report is the same, follow the main options to tentatively mark your crash as a duplicate of that report. This is usually the safest thing to do. We cannot uncombine bug reports, but we can easily merge them.
If not enough possible duplicates are found, or you did not find a similar report, then you can force it to search for more bug reports (only if the date range limit is not reached.)
If you do not find any related reports, your crash information is not useful enough, and you really cannot give additional information about the crash context, then it is better to not file the bug report, thereby closing the assistant.
Details of the bug report and your system
In this case you need to write a title and description of the crash. Explain as best you can.
You can also specify your distribution method (GNU/ Linux distribution or packaging system) or if you compiled the KDE Platform from sources.
You should write in English.
Sending the Crash Report
The last page will send the bug report to the bug tracking system and will notify you when it is done. It will then show the web address of the bug report in the KDE bug tracking system, so that you can look at the report later.
If the process fails, you can click Retry to try sending the bug report again. If the report cannot be sent because the bug tracking database has a problem, you can save it to a file to manually report later.
Thank you for being part of KDE!
If you are interested into helping us to organize bug reports allowing the developers to focus on fixing the real issues, join the BugSquad (#kde-bugs on FreeNode IRC)

You can enter a short description for files of the selected file type (e. g. 'HTML Page '). This description will be used by applications like Konqueror to display directory content.
Ask whether to save to disk instead (only for Konqueror browser)
Here you can configure what the Konqueror file manager will do when you click on a file of this type. Konqueror can either display the file in an embedded viewer, or start up a separate application. If set to'Use settings for G group ', the file manager will behave according to the settings of the group G to which this type belongs; for instance, 'image' if the current file type is image/ png. Dolphin always shows files in a separate viewer.

File Associations This module allows you to choose which applications are associated with a given type of file. File types are also referred to as MIME types (MIME is an acronym which stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"). A file association consists of the following: Rules for determining the MIME-type of a file, for example the filename pattern *. png, which means'all files with names that end in. png ', is associated with the MIME type "image/ png"; A short description of the MIME-type, for example the description of the MIME type "image/ png" is simply'PNG image'; An icon to be used for displaying files of the given MIME-type, so that you can easily identify the type of file in a file manager or file-selection dialog (at least for the types you use often); A list of the applications which can be used to open files of the given MIME-type -- if more than one application can be used then the list is ordered by priority. You may be surprised to find that some MIME types have no associated filename patterns; in these cases, KDE is able to determine the MIME-type by directly examining the contents of the file.
Find file type or filename pattern
Enter a part of a filename pattern, and only file types with a matching file pattern will appear in the list. Alternatively, enter a part of a file type name as it appears in the list.
Known Types
Here you can see a hierarchical list of the file types which are known on your system. Click on the '+ 'sign to expand a category, or the '-' sign to collapse it. Select a file type (e. g. text/ html for HTML files) to view/ edit the information for that file type using the controls on the right.
Click here to add a new file type.
& Remove
Select a file type by name or by extension
& Revert
Revert this file type to its initial system-wide definition
Click here to revert this file type to its initial system-wide definition, which undoes any changes made to the file type. Note that system-wide file types cannot be deleted. You can however empty their pattern list, to minimize the chances of them being used (but the file type determination from file contents can still end up using them).
Delete this file type definition completely
Click here to delete this file type definition completely. This is only possible for user-defined file types. System-wide file types cannot be deleted. You can however empty their pattern list, to minimize the chances of them being used (but the file type determination from file contents can still end up using them).

If you have a TFT or LCD screen you can further improve the quality of displayed fonts by selecting this option. Sub-pixel rendering is also known as ClearType(tm). In order for sub-pixel rendering to work correctly you need to know how the sub-pixels of your display are aligned. On TFT or LCD displays a single pixel is actually composed of three sub-pixels, red, green and blue. Most displays have a linear ordering of RGB sub-pixel, some have BGR. This feature does not work with CRT monitors.

Force fonts DPI:
96 DPI
120 DPI
This option forces a specific DPI value for fonts. It may be useful when the real DPI of the hardware is not detected properly and it is also often misused when poor quality fonts are used that do not look well with DPI values other than 96 or 120 DPI. The use of this option is generally discouraged. For selecting proper DPI value a better option is explicitly configuring it for the whole X server if possible (e. g. DisplaySize in xorg. conf or adding -dpi value to ServerLocalArgs= in $KDEDIR/ share/ config/ kdm/ kdmrc). When fonts do not render properly with real DPI value better fonts should be used or configuration of font hinting should be checked.
Some changes such as anti-aliasing will only affect newly started applications.

Mouse This module allows you to choose various options for the way in which your pointing device works. Your pointing device may be a mouse, trackball, or some other hardware that performs a similar function.
& General
If you are left-handed, you may prefer to swap the functions of the left and right buttons on your pointing device by choosing the'left-handed 'option. If your pointing device has more than two buttons, only those that function as the left and right buttons are affected. For example, if you have a three-button mouse, the middle button is unaffected.
The default behavior in KDE is to select and activate icons with a single click of the left button on your pointing device. This behavior is consistent with what you would expect when you click links in most web browsers. If you would prefer to select with a single click, and activate with a double click, check this option.
Activates and opens a file or folder with a single click.
If you check this option, pausing the mouse pointer over an icon on the screen will automatically select that icon. This may be useful when single clicks activate icons, and you want only to select the icon without activating it.
If you have checked the option to automatically select icons, this slider allows you to select how long the mouse pointer must be paused over the icon before it is selected.
& Cursor Theme
Advanced
x
Pointer acceleration:
This option allows you to change the relationship between the distance that the mouse pointer moves on the screen and the relative movement of the physical device itself (which may be a mouse, trackball, or some other pointing device.) A high value for the acceleration will lead to large movements of the mouse pointer on the screen even when you only make a small movement with the physical device. Selecting very high values may result in the mouse pointer flying across the screen, making it hard to control.
Pointer threshold:
The threshold is the smallest distance that the mouse pointer must move on the screen before acceleration has any effect. If the movement is smaller than the threshold, the mouse pointer moves as if the acceleration was set to 1X; thus, when you make small movements with the physical device, there is no acceleration at all, giving you a greater degree of control over the mouse pointer. With larger movements of the physical device, you can move the mouse pointer rapidly to different areas on the screen.
msec
Double click interval:
The double click interval is the maximal time (in milliseconds) between two mouse clicks which turns them into a double click. If the second click happens later than this time interval after the first click, they are recognized as two separate clicks.
Drag start time:
If you click with the mouse (e. g. in a multi-line editor) and begin to move the mouse within the drag start time, a drag operation will be initiated.
Drag start distance:
If you click with the mouse and begin to move the mouse at least the drag start distance, a drag operation will be initiated.
Mouse wheel scrolls by:
If you use the wheel of a mouse, this value determines the number of lines to scroll for each wheel movement. Note that if this number exceeds the number of visible lines, it will be ignored and the wheel movement will be handled as a page up/ down movement.

Service Manager This module allows you to have an overview of all plugins of the KDE Daemon, also referred to as KDE Services. Generally, there are two types of service: Services invoked at startup Services called on demand The latter are only listed for convenience. The startup services can be started and stopped. In Administrator mode, you can also define whether services should be loaded at startup. Use this with care: some services are vital for KDE; do not deactivate services if you do not know what you are doing.

Keyboard Repeat
If you check this option, pressing and holding down a key emits the same character over and over again. For example, pressing and holding down the Tab key will have the same effect as that of pressing that key several times in succession: Tab characters continue to be emitted until you release the key.
& Enable keyboard repeat
& Delay:
If supported, this option allows you to set the delay after which a pressed key will start generating keycodes. The'Repeat rate 'option controls the frequency of these keycodes.
& Rate:
If supported, this option allows you to set the rate at which keycodes are generated while a key is pressed.
If supported, this option allows you to hear audible clicks from your computer's speakers when you press the keys on your keyboard. This might be useful if your keyboard does not have mechanical keys, or if the sound that the keys make is very soft. You can change the loudness of the key click feedback by dragging the slider button or by clicking the up/ down arrows on the spin box. Setting the volume to 0% turns off the key click.

& Management
Cookies Cookies contain information that Konqueror (or other KDE applications using the HTTP protocol) stores on your computer, initiated by a remote Internet server. This means that a web server can store information about you and your browsing activities on your machine for later use. You might consider this an invasion of privacy. However, cookies are useful in certain situations. For example, they are often used by Internet shops, so you can'put things into a shopping basket '. Some sites require you have a browser that supports cookies. Because most people want a compromise between privacy and the benefits cookies offer, KDE offers you the ability to customize the way it handles cookies. So you might want to set KDE's default policy to ask you whenever a server wants to set a cookie, allowing you to decide. For your favorite shopping web sites that you trust, you might want to set the policy to accept, then you can access the web sites without being prompted every time KDE receives a cookie.

Cookies Cookies contain information that Konqueror (or any other KDE application using the HTTP protocol) stores on your computer from a remote Internet server. This means that a web server can store information about you and your browsing activities on your machine for later use. You might consider this an invasion of privacy. However, cookies are useful in certain situations. For example, they are often used by Internet shops, so you can'put things into a shopping basket '. Some sites require you have a browser that supports cookies. Because most people want a compromise between privacy and the benefits cookies offer, KDE offers you the ability to customize the way it handles cookies. You might, for example want to set KDE's default policy to ask you whenever a server wants to set a cookie or simply reject or accept everything. For example, you might choose to accept all cookies from your favorite shopping web site. For this all you have to do is either browse to that particular site and when you are presented with the cookie dialog box, click on This domain under the'apply to' tab and choose accept or simply specify the name of the site in the Domain Specific Policy tab and set it to accept. This enables you to receive cookies from trusted web sites without being asked every time KDE receives a cookie.

Proxy A proxy server is an intermediate program that sits between your machine and the Internet and provides services such as web page caching and/ or filtering. Caching proxy servers give you faster access to sites you have already visited by locally storing or caching the content of those pages; filtering proxy servers, on the other hand, provide the ability to block out requests for ads, spam, or anything else you want to block. Note: Some proxy servers provide both services.

Reject the so called third-party cookies. These are cookies that originate from a site other than the one you are currently browsing. For example, if you visit www. foobar. com while this option is on, only cookies that originate from www. foobar. com will be processed per your settings. Cookies from any other site will be rejected. This reduces the chances of site operators compiling a profile about your daily browsing habits.
Only accept cookies from originating server
Automatically accept temporary cookies meant to expire at the end of the current session. Such cookies will not be stored in your computer's hard drive or storage device. Instead, they are deleted when you close all applications (e. g. your browser) that use them. NOTE: Checking this option along with the next one will override your default as well as site specific cookie policies. However, doing so also increases your privacy since all cookies will be removed when the current session ends.
Automatically accept session cookies
Treat all cookies as session cookies. Session cookies are small pieces of data that are temporarily stored in your computer's memory until you quit or close all applications (e. g. your browser) that use them. Unlike regular cookies, session cookies are never stored on your hard drive or other storage medium. NOTE: Checking this option along with the previous one will override your default as well as site specific cookie policies. However, doing so also increases your privacy since all cookies will be removed when the current session ends.

Determines how cookies received from a remote machine will be handled: Ask will cause KDE to ask for your confirmation whenever a server wants to set a cookie.

Windows Shares Konqueror is able to access shared Microsoft Windows file systems, if properly configured. If there is a specific computer from which you want to browse, fill in the Browse server field. This is mandatory if you are not running Samba locally. The Broadcast address and WINS address fields will also be available, if you use the native code, or the location of the'smb. conf 'file from which the options are read, when using Samba. In any case, the broadcast address (interfaces in smb. conf) must be set up if it is guessed incorrectly or you have multiple cards. A WINS server usually improves performance, and reduces the network load a lot. The bindings are used to assign a default user for a given server, possibly with the corresponding password, or for accessing specific shares. If you choose to, new bindings will be created for logins and shares accessed during browsing. You can edit all of them from here. Passwords will be stored locally, and scrambled so as to render them unreadable to the human eye. For security reasons, you may not want to do that, as entries with passwords are clearly indicated as such.

Duplicate Identification
Browser Identification The browser-identification module allows you to have full control over how Konqueror will identify itself to web sites you browse. This ability to fake identification is necessary because some web sites do not display properly when they detect that they are not talking to current versions of either Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, even if the browser actually supports all the necessary features to render those pages properly. For such sites, you can use this feature to try to browse them. Please understand that this might not always work, since such sites might be using non-standard web protocols and or specifications. NOTE: To obtain specific help on a particular section of the dialog box, simply click on the quick help button on the window title bar, then click on the section for which you are seeking help.
Local Network Browsing Here you setup your "Network Neighborhood". You can use either the LISa daemon and the lan: / ioslave, or the ResLISa daemon and the rlan: / ioslave. About the LAN ioslave configuration: If you select it, the ioslave, if available, will check whether the host supports this service when you open this host. Please note that paranoid people might consider even this to be an attack. Always means that you will always see the links for the services, regardless of whether they are actually offered by the host. Never means that you will never have the links to the services. In both cases you will not contact the host, so nobody will ever regard you as an attacker. More information about LISa can be found at the LISa Homepage or contact Alexander Neundorf & lt; neundorf@kde. org gt;.

This is the list of URL filters that will be applied to all embedded images and media objects.
Enter an expression to filter. Filters can be defined as either: a shell-style wildcard, e. g. http: / /www. example. com/ ads*, the wildcards *? [] may be useda full regular expression by surrounding the string with '/ ', e. g. / \\/ (ad_BAR_banner)\\. / Any filter string can be preceded by '@@' to whitelist (allow) any matching URL, which takes priority over any blacklist (blocking) filter.
The filter import format is a plain text file. Blank lines, comment lines starting with '!' and the header line [AdBlock] are ignored. Any other line is added as a filter expression.
The filter export format is a plain text file. The file begins with a header line [AdBlock], then all of the filters follow each on a separate line.
Konqueror AdBlocK Konqueror AdBlocK allows you to create a list of filters that are checked against linked images and frames. URL's that match are either discarded or replaced with a placeholder image.
Tabbed Browsing

Show Introduction Page
Show My Home Page
Show Blank Page
Show My Bookmarks
Home page:
Select Home Page
This is the URL of the web page where Konqueror (as web browser) will jump to when the "Home" button is pressed. When Konqueror is started as a file manager, that button makes it jump to your local home folder instead.
Konqueror Browser Here you can configure Konqueror's browser functionality. Please note that the file manager functionality has to be configured using the "File Manager" configuration module. You can make some settings how Konqueror should handle the HTML code in the web pages it loads. It is usually not necessary to change anything here.
Bookmarks
Ask for name and folder when adding bookmarks
If this box is checked, Konqueror will allow you to change the title of the bookmark and choose a folder in which to store it when you add a new bookmark.
Show only marked bookmarks in bookmark toolbar
If this box is checked, Konqueror will show only those bookmarks in the bookmark toolbar which you have marked to do so in the bookmark editor.
Form Completion
If this box is checked, Konqueror will remember the data you enter in web forms and suggest it in similar fields for all forms.
& Maximum completions:
Here you can select how many values Konqueror will remember for a form field.
Mouse Behavior
Change cursor over links
If this option is set, the shape of the cursor will change (usually to a hand) if it is moved over a hyperlink.
Middle click opens URL in selection
If this box is checked, you can open the URL in the selection by middle clicking on a Konqueror view.
Right click goes & back in history
If this box is checked, you can go back in history by right clicking on a Konqueror view. To access the context menu, press the right mouse button and move.
Allow automatic delayed & reloading/ redirecting
Some web pages request an automatic reload or redirection after a certain period of time. By unchecking this box Konqueror will ignore these requests.

Click this button to save the Java policy to a zipped file. The file, named java_policy. tgz, will be saved to a location of your choice.
Here you can set specific Java policies for any particular host or domain. To add a new policy, simply click the New... button and supply the necessary information requested by the dialog box. To change an existing policy, click on the Change... button and choose the new policy from the policy dialog box. Clicking on the Delete button will remove the selected policy, causing the default policy setting to be used for that domain.
Enabling the security manager will cause the jvm to run with a Security Manager in place. This will keep applets from being able to read and write to your file system, creating arbitrary sockets, and other actions which could be used to compromise your system. Disable this option at your own risk. You can modify your $HOME/. java. policy file with the Java policytool utility to give code downloaded from certain sites more permissions.
Enabling this will cause the jvm to use KIO for network transport
Enter the path to the java executable. If you want to use the jre in your path, simply leave it as'java '. If you need to use a different jre, enter the path to the java executable (e. g. / usr/ lib/ jdk/ bin/ java), or the path to the directory that contains'bin/ java' (e. g. / opt/ IBMJava2-13).
If you want special arguments to be passed to the virtual machine, enter them here.
When all the applets have been destroyed, the applet server should shut down. However, starting the jvm takes a lot of time. If you would like to keep the java process running while you are browsing, you can set the timeout value to whatever you like. To keep the java process running for the whole time that the konqueror process is, leave the Shutdown Applet Server checkbox unchecked.

Konqueror Stylesheets This module allows you to apply your own color and font settings to Konqueror by using stylesheets (CSS). You can either specify options or apply your own self-written stylesheet by pointing to its location. Note that these settings will always have precedence before all other settings made by the site author. This can be useful to visually impaired people or for web pages that are unreadable due to bad design.
Heading 1 Heading 2 Heading 3 User defined stylesheets allow increased accessibility for visually handicapped people.

Enhanced Browsing In this module you can configure some enhanced browsing features of KDE. Web Shortcuts Web Shortcuts are a quick way of using Web search engines. For example, type "altavista: frobozz" or "av: frobozz" and Konqueror will do a search on AltaVista for "frobozz". Even easier: just press Alt+F2 (if you have not changed this shortcut) and enter the shortcut in the KDE Run Command dialog.

Machine:
For selecting all windows belonging to a specific application, selecting only window class should usually work.
Use window & class (whole application)
For selecting a specific window in an application, both window class and window role should be selected. Window class will determine the application, and window role the specific window in the application; many applications do not provide useful window roles though.
Use window class and window & role (specific window)
With some (non-KDE) applications whole window class can be sufficient for selecting a specific window in an application, as they set whole window class to contain both application and window role.
Use & whole window class (specific window)
Match also window & title
A single shortcut can be easily assigned or cleared using the two buttons. Only shortcuts with modifiers can be used. It is possible to have several possible shortcuts, and the first available shortcut will be used. The shortcuts are specified using space-separated shortcut sets. One set is specified as base+(list), where base are modifiers and list is a list of keys. For example "Shift+Alt+(123) Shift+Ctrl+(ABC)" will first try Shift+Alt+1, then others with Shift+Ctrl+C as the last one.

Specifying this will block more generic window settings from taking effect. Apply Initially: The window property will be only set to the given value after the window is created. No further changes will be affected. Remember: The value of the window property will be remembered and every time time the window is created, the last remembered value will be applied. Force: The window property will be always forced to the given value. Apply Now: The window property will be set to the given value immediately and will not be affected later (this action will be deleted afterwards). Force temporarily: The window property will be forced to the given value until it is hidden (this action will be deleted after the window is hidden).

Unnamed entry
You have specified the window class as unimportant. This means the settings will possibly apply to windows from all applications. If you really want to create a generic setting, it is recommended you at least limit the window types to avoid special window types.
Edit Window-Specific Settings
This configuration dialog allows altering settings only for the selected window or application. Find the setting you want to affect, enable the setting using the checkbox, select in what way the setting should be affected and to which value.

Window Behavior Here you can customize the way windows behave when being moved, resized or clicked on. You can also specify a focus policy as well as a placement policy for new windows. Please note that this configuration will not take effect if you do not use KWin as your window manager. If you do use a different window manager, please refer to its documentation for how to customize window behavior.

High
This option specifies how much KWin will try to prevent unwanted focus stealing caused by unexpected activation of new windows. (Note: This feature does not work with the Focus Under Mouse or Focus Strictly Under Mouse focus policies.) None: Prevention is turned off and new windows always become activated. Low: Prevention is enabled; when some window does not have support for the underlying mechanism and KWin cannot reliably decide whether to activate the window or not, it will be activated. This setting may have both worse and better results than the medium level, depending on the applications. Medium: Prevention is enabled. High: New windows get activated only if no window is currently active or if they belong to the currently active application. This setting is probably not really usable when not using mouse focus policy. Extreme: All windows must be explicitly activated by the user. Windows that are prevented from stealing focus are marked as demanding attention, which by default means their taskbar entry will be highlighted. This can be changed in the Notifications control module.
& Policy:
The focus policy is used to determine the active window, i. e. the window you can work in. Click to focus: A window becomes active when you click into it. This is the behavior you might know from other operating systems. Focus follows mouse: Moving the mouse pointer actively on to a normal window activates it. New windows will receive the focus, without you having to point the mouse at them explicitly. Very practical if you are using the mouse a lot. Focus under mouse: The window that happens to be under the mouse pointer is active. If the mouse points nowhere, the last window that was under the mouse has focus. New windows will not automatically receive the focus. Focus strictly under mouse: Only the window under the mouse pointer is active. If the mouse points nowhere, nothing has focus. Note that'Focus under mouse 'and'Focus strictly under mouse' prevent certain features such as the Alt+Tab walk through windows dialog in the KDE mode from working properly.
ms
When this option is enabled, a window in the background will automatically come to the front when the mouse pointer has been over it for some time.
This is the delay after which the window that the mouse pointer is over will automatically come to the front.
When this option is enabled, the active window will be brought to the front when you click somewhere into the window contents. To change it for inactive windows, you need to change the settings in the Actions tab.
When this option is enabled, there will be a delay after which the window the mouse pointer is over will become active (receive focus).
This is the delay after which the window the mouse pointer is over will automatically receive focus.
When this option is enabled, the active Xinerama screen (where new windows appear, for example) is the screen containing the mouse pointer. When disabled, the active Xinerama screen is the screen containing the focused window. By default this option is disabled for Click to focus and enabled for other focus policies.
If Shade Hover is enabled, a shaded window will un-shade automatically when the mouse pointer has been over the title bar for some time.
Sets the time in milliseconds before the window unshades when the mouse pointer goes over the shaded window.

The placement policy determines where a new window will appear on the desktop. Smart will try to achieve a minimum overlap of windows Maximizing will try to maximize every window to fill the whole screen. It might be useful to selectively affect placement of some windows using the window-specific settings. Cascade will cascade the windows Random will use a random position Centered will place the window centered Zero-Cornered will place the window in the top-left corner
& Placement:
When turned on, utility windows (tool windows, torn-off menus,...) of inactive applications will be hidden and will be shown only when the application becomes active. Note that applications have to mark the windows with the proper window type for this feature to work.

Enable this option if you want a window's content to be fully shown while moving it, instead of just showing a window'skeleton '. The result may not be satisfying on slow machines without graphic acceleration.
Enable this option if you want a window's content to be shown while resizing it, instead of just showing a window'skeleton '. The result may not be satisfying on slow machines.
Enable this option if you want a window's geometry to be displayed while it is being moved or resized. The window position relative to the top-left corner of the screen is displayed together with its size.
When enabled, this feature activates the border of maximized windows and allows you to move or resize them, just like for normal windows

Hold down the Alt key and press the Tab key repeatedly to walk through the windows on the current desktop (the Alt+Tab combination can be reconfigured). If this checkbox is checked a popup widget is shown, displaying the icons of all windows to walk through and the title of the currently selected one. Otherwise, the focus is passed to a new window each time Tab is pressed, with no popup widget. In addition, the previously activated window will be sent to the back in this mode.

Konqueror Performance You can configure several settings that improve Konqueror performance here. These include options for reusing already running instances and for keeping instances preloaded.
Disables the minimization of memory usage and allows you to make each browsing activity independent from the others
With this option activated, only one instance of Konqueror used for file browsing will exist in the memory of your computer at any moment, no matter how many file browsing windows you open, thus reducing resource requirements. Be aware that this also means that, if something goes wrong, all your file browsing windows will be closed simultaneously
With this option activated, only one instance of Konqueror will exist in the memory of your computer at any moment, no matter how many browsing windows you open, thus reducing resource requirements. Be aware that this also means that, if something goes wrong, all your browsing windows will be closed simultaneously.
If non-zero, this option allows keeping Konqueror instances in memory after all their windows have been closed, up to the number specified in this option. When a new Konqueror instance is needed, one of these preloaded instances will be reused instead, improving responsiveness at the expense of the memory required by the preloaded instances.
If enabled, an instance of Konqueror will be preloaded after the ordinary KDE startup sequence. This will make the first Konqueror window open faster, but at the expense of longer KDE startup times (but you will be able to work while it is loading, so you may not even notice that it is taking longer).
If enabled, KDE will always try to have one preloaded Konqueror instance ready; preloading a new instance in the background whenever there is not one available, so that windows will always open quickly. Warning: In some cases, it is actually possible that this will reduce perceived performance.

During startup KDE needs to perform a check of its system configuration (mimetypes, installed applications, etc.), and in case the configuration has changed since the last time, the system configuration cache (KSyCoCa) needs to be updated. This option delays the check, which avoid scanning all directories containing files describing the system during KDE startup, thus making KDE startup faster. However, in the rare case the system configuration has changed since the last time, and the change is needed before this delayed check takes place, this option may lead to various problems (missing applications in the K Menu, reports from applications about missing required mimetypes, etc.). Changes of system configuration mostly happen by (un)installing applications. It is therefore recommended to turn this option temporarily off while (un)installing applications.

& Statistics
The Samba and NFS Status Monitor is a front end to the programs smbstatus and showmount. Smbstatus reports on current Samba connections, and is part of the suite of Samba tools, which implements the SMB (Session Message Block) protocol, also called the NetBIOS or LanManager protocol. This protocol can be used to provide printer sharing or drive sharing services on a network including machines running the various flavors of Microsoft Windows.

Screen Saver This module allows you to enable and configure a screen saver. Note that you can enable a screen saver even if you have power saving features enabled for your display. Besides providing an endless variety of entertainment and preventing monitor burn-in, a screen saver also gives you a simple way to lock your display if you are going to leave it unattended for a while. If you want the screen saver to lock the session, make sure you enable the "Require password" feature of the screen saver; if you do not, you can still explicitly lock the session using the desktop's "Lock Session" action.

Your names
Enable background
If this is checked, KDM will use the settings below for the background. If it is disabled, you have to look after the background yourself. This is done by running some program (possibly xsetroot) in the script specified in the Setup= option in kdmrc (usually Xsetup).
Attention Read help
Enable Auto-Login
Turn on the auto-login feature. This applies only to KDM's graphical login. Think twice before enabling this!
User:
Select the user to be logged in automatically.
Lock session
The automatically started session will be locked immediately (provided it is a KDE session). This can be used to obtain a super-fast login restricted to one user.
Preselect User
& None
Previous
Preselect the user that logged in previously. Use this if this computer is usually used several consecutive times by one user.
Specified:
Preselect the user specified in the combo box to the right. Use this if this computer is predominantly used by a certain user.
Select the user to be preselected for login. This box is editable, so you can specify an arbitrary non-existent user to mislead possible attackers.
Focus password
When this option is on, KDM will place the cursor in the password field instead of the user field after preselecting a user. Use this to save one key press per login, if the preselection usually does not need to be changed.
Enable Password-Less Logins
When this option is checked, the checked users from the list below will be allowed to log in without entering their password. This applies only to KDM's graphical login. Think twice before enabling this!
No password required for:
Check all users you want to allow a password-less login for. Entries denoted with '@ 'are user groups. Checking a group is like checking all users in that group.
Miscellaneous
Automatically log in again after & X server crash
When this option is on, a user will be logged in again automatically when their session is interrupted by an X server crash; note that this can open a security hole: if you use a screen locker than KDE's integrated one, this will make circumventing a password-secured screen lock possible.
& Greeting:
This is the "headline" for KDM's login window. You may want to put some nice greeting or information about the operating system here. KDM will substitute the following character pairs with the respective contents: %d - > current display %h - > host name, possibly with domain name %n - > node name, most probably the host name without domain name %s - > the operating system %r - > the operating system's version %m - > the machine (hardware) type%% - > a single%

Login Manager In this module you can configure the various aspects of the KDE Login Manager. This includes the look and feel as well as the users that can be selected for login. Note that you can only make changes if you run the module with superuser rights. If you have not started the KDE System Settings with superuser rights (which is absolutely the right thing to do, by the way), click on the Modify button to acquire superuser rights. You will be asked for the superuser password. General On this tab page, you can configure parts of the Login Manager's look, and which language it should use. The language settings made here have no influence on the user's language settings. Dialog Here you can configure the look of the "classical" dialog based mode if you have chosen to use it. Background If you want to set a special background for the dialog based login screen, this is where to do it. Themes Here you can specify a theme to be used by the Login Manager. Shutdown Here you can specify who is allowed to shutdown/ reboot the machine and whether a boot manager should be used. Users On this tab page, you can select which users the Login Manager will offer you for logging in. Convenience Here you can specify a user to be logged in automatically, users not needing to provide a password to log in, and other convenience features. Note, that these settings are security holes by their nature, so use them very carefully.
& General
& Dialog
There is no login dialog window in themed mode.
& Background
The background cannot be configured separately in themed mode.
& Theme
Themed mode is disabled. See "General" tab.
& Shutdown
& Users
& Convenience
Drag the anchor to move the center of the dialog to the desired position. Keyboard control is possible as well: Use the arrow keys or Home to center. Note that the actual proportions of the dialog are probably different.

All Fonts contains all the fonts installed on your system. Unclassified contains all fonts that have not yet been placed within a "Custom" group.
All Fonts contains all the fonts installed on your system - both "System" and "Personal". System contains all fonts that are installed system-wide (i. e. available to all users). Personal contains your personal fonts. Unclassified contains all fonts that have not yet been placed within a "Custom" group.
Font Groups This list displays the font groups available on your system. There are 2 main types of font groups: Standard are special groups used by the font manager. %1 Custom are groups created by you. To add a font family to one of these groups simply drag it from the list of fonts, and drop onto the desired group. To remove a family from the group, drag the font onto the "All Fonts" group.

General
The fonts shown are your personal fonts. To see (and install) system-wide fonts, click on the "Administrator Mode" button below.
Configure...
Output:
Modern applications use a system called "FontConfig" to obtain the list of fonts. Older applications, such as OpenOffice 1. x, GIMP 1. x, etc. use the previous "core X fonts" mechanism for this. Selecting this option will inform the installer to create the necessary files so that these older applications can use the fonts you install. Please note, however, that this will slow down the installation process.
When printing, most applications create what is know as PostScript. This is then sent to a special application, named Ghostscript, which can interpret the PostScript and send the appropriate instructions to your printer. If your application does not embed whatever fonts it uses into the PostScript, then Ghostscript needs to be informed as to which fonts you have installed, and where they are located. Selecting this option will create the necessary Ghostscript config files. Please note, however, that this will also slow down the installation process. As most applications can, and do, embed the fonts into the PostScript before sending this to Ghostscript, this option can safely be disabled.
You have enabled a previously disabled option. Would you like the config files updated now? (Normally they are only updated upon installing, or removing, a font.)
Do you wish to install the font into "%1" (in which case the font will only be usable by you), or "%2" (the font will be usable by all users - but you will need to know the administrator's password)?
Only fonts may be installed. If installing a fonts package (*%1), then extract the components, and install individually.
Where do you wish to install "%1" (%2)? "%3" - only accessible to you, or "%4" - accessible to all (requires administrator password)

KIO Client
Command-line tool for network-transparent operations
Syntax:
kioclient openProperties'url '# Opens a properties menu
kioclient exec'url '['mimetype'] # Tries to open the document pointed to by'url ', in the application # associated with it in KDE. You may omit'mimetype'. # In this case the mimetype is determined # automatically. Of course URL may be the URL of a # document, or it may be a *. desktop file. # 'url 'can be an executable, too.
kioclient move'src ''dest' # Moves the URL'src 'to'dest'. # 'src 'may be a list of URLs.
# 'dest 'may be "trash: /" to move the files # to the trash.
# the short version kioclient mv # is also available.
kioclient download ['src '] # Copies the URL'src' to a user-specified location '. # 'src' may be a list of URLs, if not present then # a URL will be requested.
kioclient copy'src ''dest' # Copies the URL'src 'to'dest'. # 'src 'may be a list of URLs.
kioclient cat'url '# Writes out the contents of'url' to stdout
kioclient remove'url '# Removes the URL # 'url' may be a list of URLs.
# the short version kioclient rm # is also available.
*** Examples: kioclient exec file: / root/ Desktop/ cdrom. desktop "Mount default" / / Mounts the CDROM
kioclient exec file: / home/ weis/ data/ test. html / / Opens the file with default binding
kioclient exec file: / home/ weis/ data/ test. html Netscape / / Opens the file with netscape
kioclient exec ftp: / /localhost/ / / Opens new window with URL
kioclient exec file: / root/ Desktop/ emacs. desktop / / Starts emacs
kioclient exec file: / root/ Desktop/ cdrom. desktop / / Opens the CDROM's mount directory
kioclient exec. / / Opens the current directory. Very convenient.

Clipboard/ Selection Behavior
Separate clipboard and selection
This option prevents the selection being recorded in the clipboard history. Only explicit clipboard changes are recorded.
There are two different clipboard buffers available: Clipboard is filled by selecting something and pressing Ctrl+C, or by clicking "Copy" in a toolbar or menubar. Selection is available immediately after selecting some text. The only way to access the selection is to press the middle mouse button. You can configure the relationship between Clipboard and Selection.

Next: An Introduction to Konqueror
Search the Web
Konqueror makes working with and managing your files easy. You can browse both local and networked folders while enjoying advanced features such as the powerful sidebar and file previews.
Konqueror is also a full featured and easy to use web browser which you can use to explore the Internet. Enter the address (e. g. http: / /www. kde. org) of a web page you would like to visit in the location bar and press Enter, or choose an entry from the Bookmarks menu.
To return to the previous location, press the back button in the toolbar.
To quickly go to your Home folder press the home button.
For more detailed documentation on Konqueror click here.
Tuning Tip: If you want the Konqueror web browser to start faster, you can turn off this information screen by clicking here. You can re-enable it by choosing the Help - > Konqueror Introduction menu option, and then pressing Settings - > Save View Profile As... - > "Web Browsing".
Next: Tips & Tricks
Konqueror is designed to embrace and support Internet standards. The aim is to fully implement the officially sanctioned standards from organizations such as the W3 and OASIS, while also adding extra support for other common usability features that arise as de facto standards across the Internet. Along with this support, for such functions as favicons, Web Shortcuts, and XBEL bookmarks, Konqueror also implements:
Supported standards

Tips & Tricks
Use Web-Shortcuts: by typing "gg: KDE" one can search the Internet, using Google, for the search phrase "KDE". There are a lot of Web-Shortcuts predefined to make searching for software or looking up certain words in an encyclopedia a breeze. You can even create your own Web-Shortcuts.
Use the magnifier button in the toolbar to increase the font size on your web page.
When you want to paste a new address into the Location toolbar you might want to clear the current entry by pressing the black arrow with the white cross in the toolbar.
To create a link on your desktop pointing to the current page, simply drag the "Location" label that is to the left of the Location toolbar, drop it on to the desktop, and choose "Link".
You can also find "Full-Screen Mode" in the Settings menu. This feature is very useful for "Talk" sessions.
Divide et impera (lat. "Divide and conquer") - by splitting a window into two parts (e. g. Window - > Split View Left/ Right) you can make Konqueror appear the way you like. You can even load some example view-profiles (e. g. Midnight Commander), or create your own ones.
Use the user-agent feature if the website you are visiting asks you to use a different browser (and do not forget to send a complaint to the webmaster!)
The History in your SideBar ensures that you can keep track of the pages you have visited recently.
Use a caching proxy to speed up your Internet connection.

Shortcuts
None
In this module you can configure the web shortcuts feature. Web shortcuts allow you to quickly search or lookup words on the Internet. For example, to search for information about the KDE project using the Google engine, you simply type gg: KDE or google: KDE. If you select a default search engine, normal words or phrases will be looked up at the specified search engine by simply typing them into applications, such as Konqueror, that have built-in support for such a feature.
Search Filters
Enable shortcuts that allow you to quickly search for information on the web. For example, entering the shortcut gg: KDE will result in a search for the word KDE on the Google(TM) search engine.

Select the search engine to use for input boxes that provide automatic lookup services when you type in normal words and phrases instead of a URL. To disable this feature select None from the list.
Default & search engine:
Choose the delimiter that separates the keyword from the phrase or word to be searched.
& Keyword delimiter:
Colon
Space
Enter the human-readable name of the search provider here.
Search & provider name:
Enter the URI that is used to perform a search on the search engine here. The whole text to be searched for can be specified as \\{@} or \\{0}. Recommended is \\{@}, since it removes all query variables (name=value) from the resulting string, whereas \\{0} will be substituted with the unmodified query string. You can use \\{1}... \\{n} to specify certain words from the query and \\{name} to specify a value given by'name=value 'in the user query. In addition it is possible to specify multiple references (names, numbers and strings) at once (\\{name1, name2,..., "string"}). The first matching value (from the left) will be used as the substitution value for the resulting URI. A quoted string can be used as the default value if nothing matches from the left of the reference list.
Search & URI:
The shortcuts entered here can be used as a pseudo-URI scheme in KDE. For example, the shortcut av can be used as in av: my search
URI shortcuts:
Select the character set that will be used to encode your search query
& Charset:
Select the character set that will be used to encode your search query.

The URI does not contain a \\{...} placeholder for the user query. This means that the same page is always going to be visited, regardless of what the user types.

The KDE Wallet system stores your data in a wallet file on your local hard disk. The data is only written in encrypted form, presently using the blowfish algorithm with your password as the key. When a wallet is opened, the wallet manager application will launch and display an icon in the system tray. You can use this application to manage your wallets. It even permits you to drag wallets and wallet contents, allowing you to easily copy a wallet to a remote system.
The KDE Wallet System
Welcome to KWallet, the KDE Wallet System. KWallet allows you to store your passwords and other personal information on disk in an encrypted file, preventing others from viewing the information. This wizard will tell you about KWallet and help you configure it for the first time.
& Basic setup (recommended)
& Advanced setup
The KDE Wallet system allows you to control the level of security of your personal data. Some of these settings do impact usability. While the default settings are generally acceptable for most users, you may wish to change some of them. You may further tune these settings from the KWallet control module.
Automatically close idle wallets
Store network passwords and local passwords in separate wallet files
Various applications may attempt to use the KDE wallet to store passwords or other information such as web form data and cookies. If you would like these applications to use the wallet, you must enable it now and choose a password. The password you choose cannot be recovered if it is lost, and will allow anyone who knows it to obtain all the information contained in the wallet.
Yes, I wish to use the KDE wallet to store my personal information.

Select whether realtime scheduling should be enabled for the application. The scheduler governs which process will run and which will have to wait. Two schedulers are available: Normal: This is the standard, timesharing scheduler. It will divide fairly the available processing time between all processes. Realtime: This scheduler will run your application uninterrupted until it gives up the processor. This can be dangerous. An application that does not give up the processor might hang the system. You need root's password to use the scheduler.

PowerDevil Configuration
A configurator for PowerDevil
(c), 2008 Dario Freddi
From this module, you can configure the Daemon, create and edit powersaving profiles, and see your system's capabilities.
PowerDevil configuration This module lets you configure PowerDevil. PowerDevil is a daemon (so it runs in background) that is started upon KDE startup. PowerDevil has 2 levels of configuration: a general one, that is always applied, and a profile-based one, that lets you configure a specific behavior in every situation. You can also have a look at your system capabilities in the last tab. To get you started, first configure the options in the first 2 tabs. Then switch to the fourth one, and create/ edit your profiles. Last but not least, assign your profiles in the third Tab. You do not have to restart PowerDevil, just click "Apply", and you are done.
Another power manager has been detected. PowerDevil will not start if other power managers are active. If you want to use PowerDevil as your primary power manager, please remove the existing one and restart the PowerDevil service.
It seems powersaved is running on this system. PowerDevil will not start if other power managers are active. If you want to use PowerDevil as your primary power manager, please stop powersaved and restart the PowerDevil service.
PowerDevil seems not to be started. Either you have its service turned off, or there is a problem in D-Bus.
No methods found
No scaling methods were found. If your CPU is reasonably recent, this is probably because you have not loaded some kernel modules. Usually scaling modules have names similar to cpufreq_ondemand. Scaling is useful and can save a lot of battery. Click on "Attempt Loading Modules" to let PowerDevil try to load the required modules. If you are sure your PC does not support scaling, you can also disable this warning by clicking "Do not display this warning again".
Attempt to load modules
Do not display this warning again
ConsoleKit was not found active on your PC, or PowerDevil cannot contact it. ConsoleKit lets PowerDevil detect whether the current session is active, which is useful if you have more than one user logged into your system at any one time.
No issues found with your configuration.
No kernel modules for CPU scaling were found. Either you do not have them installed, or PowerDevil could not detect them.

PowerDevil was compiled without Xss and Xext support, or the XSync extension is not available. Determining idle time will not be possible. Please consider recompiling PowerDevil with at least one of these two libraries.
PowerDevil was compiled without Xext support, or the XSync extension is not available. XSync grants extra efficiency and performance, saving your battery and CPU. It is advised to use PowerDevil with XSync enabled.
XSync does not seem to be your preferred query backend, though it is available on your system. Using it largely improves performance and efficiency, and is strongly advised. Click on the button below to enable it now.

Change scheduling priority for:
CPU Scheduler
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} The standard time-sharing scheduler for processes without special requirements.
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Normal Scheduling: Default Linux time-sharing (Other) Normal is the standard Linux time-sharing scheduler that is intended for all processes that do not require special static priority real-time mechanisms. The process to run is chosen from the list of other Normal or Batch processes based on a dynamic priority that is determined only inside this list. The dynamic priority is based on the priority level given and increased for each time-quantum the process is ready to run, but denied to run by the scheduler. This ensures fair progress among all Normal processes.
Normal
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} For CPU-intensive non-interactive processes. Process is mildly disfavored in scheduling decisions.
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Batch Scheduling (Since Linux 2.6.16.) This policy is similar to Normal, except that this policy will cause the scheduler to always assume that the process is CPU-intensive. Consequently, the scheduler will apply a small scheduling penalty so that this process is mildly disfavored in scheduling decisions. This policy is useful for workloads that are non-interactive, but do not want to lower their nice value, and for workloads that want a deterministic scheduling policy without interactivity causing extra preemptions (between the workload's tasks).
Batch
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Process will run whenever runnable. Higher priority than Normal or Batch. Has Timeslicing.
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Round Robin Scheduling Round Robin is a simple enhancement of FIFO. Everything described below for FIFO also applies to Round Robin, except that each process is only allowed to run for a maximum time quantum.
Round robin
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Process will run whenever runnable. Higher priority than Normal or Batch. No timeslicing.
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} First In-First Out Scheduling When a FIFO process becomes runnable, it will always immediately preempt any currently running Normal or Batch process.
FIFO
I/ O Scheduler
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Process's priority is based on the CPU priority.
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Normal Scheduling This is the same as Best Effort scheduling, except that the priority is calculated automatically based on the CPU priority. Processes with a higher priority will take priority for access to the hard disk. Programs running at the same Best Effort/ Normal priority are served in a Round Robin fashion.
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Process can only use the hard disk when no other process has used it very recently.
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Idle Scheduling A program running with Idle I/ O priority will only get disk time when no other program has asked for disk I/ O for a defined grace period. The impact of Idle I/ O processes on normal system activity should be zero. Priority is not applicable to this scheduling class.
Idle
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Process is given higher priority to access the hard disk than Normal.
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Best Effort Scheduling Processes with a higher priority will take priority for access to the hard disk. Programs running at the same Best Effort/ Normal priority are served in a Round Robin fashion.
Best effort
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Process gets immediate access to the hard disk whenever needed, regardless of what else is going on.
p, li {white-space: pre-wrap;} Real Time Scheduling The Real Time scheduling class is given first access to the disk, regardless of what else is going on in the system. Thus the Real Time class needs to be used with some care, as it can starve other processes. As with the Best Effort class, 8 priority levels are defined denoting how big a time slice a given process will receive on each scheduling window.

- Process is doing some work.

- Process has finished and is now dead, but the parent process has not cleaned up.
The process name.
The user who owns this process.
The controlling terminal on which this process is running.
The priority with which this process is being run. Ranges from 19 (very nice, least priority) to -19 (top priority).
The current CPU usage of the process.
The current total CPU usage of the process.
This is the amount of virtual memory space that the process is using, included shared libraries, graphics memory, files on disk, and so on. This number is almost meaningless.
This is the amount of real physical memory that this process is using by itself. It does not include any swapped out memory, nor the code size of its shared libraries. This is often the most useful figure to judge the memory use of a program.
This is the amount of real physical memory that this process's shared libraries are using. This memory is shared among all processes that use this library.
The command with which this process was launched.
The title of any windows that this process is showing.
The unique Process ID that identifies this process.
The number of bytes read. See What's This for more information.
The number of bytes written. See What's This for more information.
Technical information: The kernel process name is a maximum of 8 characters long, so the full command is examined. If the first word in the full command line starts with the process name, the first word of the command line is shown, otherwise the process name is used.
The user who owns this process. If the effective, setuid etc user is different, the user who owns the process will be shown, followed by the effective user. The ToolTip contains the full information. Login Name/ GroupThe username of the Real User/ Group who created this processEffective User/ GroupThe process is running with privileges of the Effective User/ Group. This is shown if different from the real user. Setuid User/ GroupThe saved username of the binary. The process can escalate its Effective User/ Group to the Setuid User/ Group. File System User/ GroupAccesses to the filesystem are checked with the File System User/ Group. This is a Linux specific call. See setfsuid(2) for more information.
This is the size of allocated address space - not memory, but address space. This value in practice means next to nothing. When a process requests a large memory block from the system but uses only a small part of it, the real usage will be low, VIRT will be high. Technical information: This is VmSize in proc/ */ status and VIRT in top.
Technical information: This is the URSS - Unique Resident Set Size, calculated as VmRSS - Shared, from / proc/ */ statm. This tends to underestimate the'true 'memory usage of a process (by not including i/ o backed memory pages), but is the best estimation that is fast to determine.
The CPU usage of a process and all of its threads.
Technical information: This is the Shared memory, called SHR in top. It is the number of pages that are backed by a file (see kernel Documentation/ filesystems/ proc. txt.)
Technical information: This is from / proc/ */ cmdline
Technical information: For each X11 window, the X11 property _NET_WM_PID is used to map the window to a PID. If a process' windows are not shown, then that application incorrectly is not setting _NET_WM_PID.
Technical information: This is the Process ID. A multi-threaded application is treated a single process, with all threads sharing the same PID. The CPU usage etc will be the total, accumulated, CPU usage of all the threads.
This column shows the IO statistics for each process. The tooltip provides the following information: Characters ReadThe number of bytes which this task has caused to be read from storage. This is simply the sum of bytes which this process passed to read() and pread(). It includes things like tty IO and it is unaffected by whether or not actual physical disk IO was required (the read might have been satisfied from pagecache). Characters WrittenThe number of bytes which this task has caused, or shall cause to be written to disk. Similar caveats apply here as with Characters Read. Read SyscallsThe number of read I/ O operations, i. e. syscalls like read() and pread(). Write SyscallsThe number of write I/ O operations, i. e. syscalls like write() and pwrite(). Actual Bytes ReadThe number of bytes which this process really did cause to be fetched from the storage layer. Done at the submit_bio() level, so it is accurate for block-backed filesystems. This may not give sensible values for NFS and CIFS filesystems. Actual Bytes WrittenAttempt to count the number of bytes which this process caused to be sent to the storage layer. This is done at page-dirtying time. The number in brackets shows the rate at which each value is changing, determined from taking the difference between the previous value and the new value, and dividing by the update interval. Technical information: This data is collected from / proc/ */ io and is documented further in Documentation/ accounting and Documentation/ filesystems/ proc. txt in the kernel source.

The equation solver allows you to balance a chemical equation. Using VariablesTo express variable quantities of an element, put a single character in front of the element's symbol, as shown in this example: aH + bO - > 5H2O (Result: 10 H + 5 O -gt; 5 H2O)Solving this expression will give you the needed amount of Hydrogen and Oxygen. Defining electric chargesUse box brackets to specify the electric charge of an element, as shown in this example:4H[+] + 2O - > cH2O[2+] (Result: 4 H+ + 2 O -gt; 2 H2O2+)

Killbots
Classic
The rules used in the original BSD command line version of robots. Nothing fancy, just the basic game elements: no fastbots, no safe teleports, no pushing junkheaps, and a huge game grid. Due to its larger width, it is recommended that you use a theme with narrower tiles to better fit your screen.
Daleks
An approximation of the rules used in Daleks, a robots-like game for early Apple computers. The hero is allotted one energy each round that can be used to power the sonic screwdriver. All other special features are disabled.

Tutorial Course
Welcome to the tutorial course for Kolf!
To hit the ball, press and hold the Down Arrow or left mouse button. How long you hold down the mouse button or key determines strength of the shot.
To aim the putter, press the Left (rotate counterclockwise) and Right (rotate clockwise) Arrow keys or use the mouse.
Bridges Bridges can have walls on the top, bottom, left, or right.
Everything Here's a hole that has it all. Have fun with Kolf! -- Jason Katz-Brown
Slopes Slopes are slanted areas of ground that push the ball in the direction that they slope. This direction is shown when you choose Hole- > Show Info.
Hit the ball onto the slope and let it roll into cup.
Try out these different types of slopes.
The steepness of a slope is shown when you choose Hole- > Show Info. Steepness goes from 8 (steepest) to 1 (shallowest).
Walls Bounce the ball off of the red walls.
Sand Sand is yellow, and slows your ball down.
Puddles (Water) Hitting into a puddle (blue) adds a penalty stroke to your score, and your ball is placed outside the puddle.
Windmills Windmills (brown base with moving arm) have brown walls (or half walls). The speed of the windmill arm may vary for each hole.
Black Holes Black Holes transport the ball to their exit, and eject it at a speed in direct relation to the speed your ball was traveling. Choose Hole- > Show Info to see which Black Hole goes to which exit and the direction the ball will come out.
Floaters Floaters are moving platforms that carry a ball that lands on it. Floaters' speeds vary.

Conversely if you suspect an error in Konqueror, please file a bug report at http: / /bugs. kde. org/. A test case which illustrates the problem will be appreciated.
