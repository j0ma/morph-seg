# TODO
- [x] Get gold standard analyses from LinguaRobot for hyperparameters
- [x] Get flatcat segmentation error to go away
    - If all else fails, use command line utilities
- [x] Make sure new separated morfessor scripts work


## LATER
- [] Create hyperparameter-tunable experiment script for baseline
    - What metric? How do I see it?
    - Dev set log likelihood if using unsupervised?
- [] Check out guild.ai and see if it can help with this
